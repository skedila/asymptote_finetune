Both circles share the same center at the origin (0,0).\n\nThe region of interest is the annular area between these two circles. This area is filled with a color that is a blend of yellow and white, with the white component being dominant (specifically, the fill color is 90% white and 10% yellow). The boundary of each circle is drawn with a visible outline.\n\nTo visualize this, imagine a donut-shaped region centered at the origin. The outer boundary of the donut is the larger circle with a radius of 2 cm, while the inner boundary is the smaller circle with a radius of 1 cm. The entire annular region is filled with the specified color blend, and both circular boundaries are distinctly outlined."}
