 Consider a geometric diagram consisting of three points and two paths connecting these points in a specific manner.

1. **Points**:
   - Let point \( A \) be located at the origin, with coordinates \( (0, 0) \).
   - Let point \( B \) be at coordinates \( (3, 0.5) \) centimeters.
   - Let point \( C \) be at coordinates \( (6, 0) \) centimeters.

2. **Paths**:
   - The first path is a smooth curve starting at point \( A \), passing through point \( B \), and ending at point \( C \). This curve is drawn with default styling (black color).
     - At point \( A \), the tangent to the curve is directed north.
     - At point \( B \), the tangent to the curve is directed east.
     - At point \( C \), the tangent to the curve is directed south.

   - The second path
