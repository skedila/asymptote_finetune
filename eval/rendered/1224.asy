You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a diagram that involves both a standard Cartesian coordinate system and a transformed coordinate system. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Coordinate System**: 
   - The diagram initially starts with a standard Cartesian coordinate system, where the x-axis and y-axis intersect at the origin (0,0).

2. **Points in the Standard Coordinate System**: 
   - Point \( A \) is placed at coordinates \( (0, 0.5) \).
   - Point \( B \) is placed at coordinates \( (1, 0.5) \).

3. **Plotting Points**:
   - Both points \( A \) and \( B \) are marked with dots and labeled accordingly as \( A \) and \( B \).

4. **Transformed Coordinate System**:
   - A new coordinate system, referred to as `currentcoordsys`, is introduced. This system has its origin at \( (0
