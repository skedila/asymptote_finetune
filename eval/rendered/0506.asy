 Consider a square plotted on a Cartesian plane, where the vertices of the square are located at the points \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), \((1,1)\), and \((0,1)\). This square is known as the unit square.

Within this unit square, two diagonals are drawn. The first diagonal connects the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, specifically from \((0,0)\) to \((1,1)\). The second diagonal connects the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner, specifically from \((1,0)\) to \((0,1)\).

At each of the four vertices of the square, as well as the two points where the diagonals intersect the edges of the square, a dot is placed. These points are \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), \((1,1)\), \((0,1)\), as well as the midpoints
