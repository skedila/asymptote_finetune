 Consider a Cartesian coordinate plane with the x-axis ranging from \(-3\) to \(3\) and the y-axis also ranging from \(-3\) to \(3\). The axes are labeled with \(x\) and \(y\), respectively, and are marked with appropriate ticks for reference.

In this coordinate plane, we examine the level curve of the function \(f(x, y) = xy\). Specifically, we are interested in the contour line where the function value is equal to \(1\). This contour line represents the set of points \((x, y)\) in the plane such that the product of the coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) equals \(1\).

The contour line \(xy = 1\) is a hyperbola. It consists of two branches, one in the first quadrant where both \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\), and another in the third quadrant where both \(x <
