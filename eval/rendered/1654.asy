 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric diagram involving a triangle and its anticomplementary triangle. Here's a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Original Triangle \( t \):**
   - The vertices of triangle \( t \) are given by the coordinates \( A = (-1, 0) \), \( B = (2, 0) \), and \( C = (0, 2) \).
   - This triangle is drawn with a standard line width.

2. **Anticomplementary Triangle \( at \):**
   - The anticomplementary triangle \( at \) of triangle \( t \) is constructed and drawn in the diagram. 
   - The vertices of this triangle are labeled as \( A' \), \( B' \), and \( C' \), and are displayed in blue.

3. **Visual Style and Annotations:**
   - The sides of the anticomplementary triangle \( at \) are drawn with a green
