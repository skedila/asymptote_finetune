You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a mathematical diagram illustrating the interpolation of a set of data points using three different interpolation methods. The diagram is set within a coordinate plane with specified axes, and the following elements are included:

1. **Data Points**: There are seven distinct data points plotted on the graph, given by the coordinates: 
   - (1, 1)
   - (2, 2)
   - (4, 2)
   - (5, 3)
   - (7, 1)
   - (8, 0.5)
   - (10, 3)
   
   These points are marked as black dots with a size of 4bp (big points) and a slight transparency (0.7 opacity).

2. **Axes**: 
   - The x-axis is labeled with "$x$" and includes tick marks at integer intervals from 1 to 10, with additional minor ticks at 0.25 intervals
