You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric diagram featuring an ellipse and several key points associated with it. The diagram is constructed in a non-standard coordinate system, which affects the positioning and orientation of the elements.

1. **Coordinate System**: 
   - The diagram uses a custom Cartesian coordinate system. The origin is at the point \((0,0)\). The basis vectors for this coordinate system are \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75)\).

2. **Ellipse**:
   - Center: The ellipse is centered at the point \(A = (4, 2)\) in the custom coordinate system.
   - Semi-major axis length: 3 units.
   - Semi-minor axis length: 2 units.
   - Rotation: The ellipse is rotated by \(20^\circ\) counterclockwise from the positive x-axis of the custom coordinate system.
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

// Define the custom coordinate system
point i = (1, 0.5);
point j = (-0.5, 0.75);

// Define the ellipse
point A = (4, 2);
real a = 3;
real b = 2;
real theta = 20*pi/180;

// Draw the ellipse
draw(ellipse(A, a, b, theta));

// Draw the basis vectors
draw(i*i, red);
draw(j*j, blue);

// Label the points
label("$A$", A, N);
label("$i$", i*i, S);
label("$j$", j*j, S);

// Show the diagram
show(scale=1.5);
