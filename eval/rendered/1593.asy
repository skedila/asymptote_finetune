You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 Construct a geometric diagram based on the following detailed instructions:

1. **Coordinate System and Setup**:
   - Consider a Cartesian coordinate system with a unit size of 4 cm.
   - Define a point \( A \) at the coordinates \( (3.5, 0.75) \).

2. **Points and Labels**:
   - Place a point \( A \) and label it as \( A \) with a dot below the point.
   - Calculate point \( B \) by moving from \( A \) a vector defined by the components \( (\cos(0.5), \cos(1)) \). Place a point \( B \) here and label it as \( B \) with a dot below the point.

3. **Circle and Arcs**:
   - Draw a circle centered at point \( A \) with a radius of 2 units.
   - From this circle, construct an arc \( c \) starting at 45 degrees and
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

size(4cm);

point A = (3.5, 0.75);
point B = A + (cos(0.5), cos(1));

draw(A--B, red);
dot(A, below);
dot(B, below);

draw(circle(A, 2), red);
arc(A, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225);

label("$A$", A, S);
label("$B$", B, S);

draw(arc(A, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225), red);
