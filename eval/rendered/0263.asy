 Consider a Cartesian coordinate system where the origin is at point \( (0, 0) \). The system is transformed such that the unit vectors are \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5) \) and \( \mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75) \). Within this transformed coordinate system, we define the following geometric constructs:

1. **Ellipse \( \mathcal{E} \)**: The ellipse is centered at point \( A = (4, 2) \). It has a semi-major axis of length 3, a semi-minor axis of length 2, and is rotated by 20 degrees counterclockwise from the positive \( x \)-axis.

2. **Center and Foci**:
   - The center of the ellipse \( \mathcal{E} \) is labeled as \( C \), and it is marked with a red dot at the position \( el.C \).
   -
 import geometry;

draw(ellipse(4, 2, 3, 2, 20));

point A = (4, 2);
point C = A + 3*dir(20);
point F1 = A + 3*dir(20 + 120);
point F2 = A + 3*dir(20 - 120);

draw(C--F1, red);
draw(C--F2, red);

dot(C, red);
dot(F1, red);
dot(F2, red);

label("$C$", C, S);
label("$F_1$", F1, N);
label("$F_2$", F2, S);

draw(A--C, red);
draw(A--F1, red);
draw(A--F2, red);

label("$A$", A, N);
