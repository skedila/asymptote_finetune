You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a three-dimensional diagram with the following elements:

1. **Coordinate Axes**: 
   - The diagram includes three coordinate axes originating from the origin \( O = (0, 0, 0) \).
   - The **x-axis** is represented by a directed line segment from \( O \) to \( X = (1, 0, 0) \). This axis is labeled with the letter \( x \) at its terminal point.
   - The **y-axis** is represented by a directed line segment from \( O \) to \( Y = (0, 1, 0) \). This axis is labeled with the letter \( y \) at its terminal point.
   - The **z-axis** is represented by a directed line segment from \( O \) to \( Z = (0, 0, 1) \). This axis is labeled with the letter \( z \) at its terminal
