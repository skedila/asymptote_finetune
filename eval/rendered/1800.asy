You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a plot of several beta distribution probability density functions, each corresponding to different pairs of parameters \((\alpha, \beta)\). Here is a detailed description of what the diagram looks like:

**Title: Plot of Beta Distribution Probability Density Functions**

**Description:**

The diagram is a plot on a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis ranging from 0 to 1 and the y-axis from 0 to 2.6. The axes are labeled as follows:
- The horizontal axis (x-axis) is labeled with "$x$".
- The vertical axis (y-axis) is labeled with "$y$".

Both axes have tick marks: 
- The x-axis has ticks at regular intervals (not specified in detail but covering the range from 0 to 1).
- The y-axis has ticks at intervals of 0.2, covering the range from 0 to 2.6.

**Curves:**

Five distinct curves are
