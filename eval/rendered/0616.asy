You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 In this problem, you are asked to visualize a geometric diagram involving a line segment and arrows. Follow these instructions to construct the diagram accurately:

1. **Coordinate System and Units**: Begin by establishing a Cartesian coordinate system where each unit measures 3 centimeters. This will help in accurately plotting the points and drawing the line segment.

2. **Line Segment**: Draw a horizontal line segment \( g \) from the point \( (0,0) \) to the point \( (1,0) \). This line segment lies along the x-axis, starting at the origin and extending to the point where \( x = 1 \).

3. **Arrows on the Line Segment**:
   - Place an arrow on the line segment \( g \) at a position that is 45% of the way from the starting point \( (0,0) \) to the ending point \( (1,0) \). This arrow should point in the direction from \( (0
