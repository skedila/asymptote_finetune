You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a geometric diagram consisting of two distinct elements: a circle and a square. Follow these detailed instructions to construct the diagram accurately:

1. **Circle:**
   - Draw a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 1 unit. This is known as the unit circle.
   - Ensure that the circle is outlined with visible points (dots) along its circumference. These dots should be of a standard size for clarity.

2. **Square:**
   - Construct a square by first considering the standard unit square with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), \((1, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\).
   - Apply a translation to this unit square by shifting it \(-0.5\) units along the x-axis and \(-0.5\) units along the y-axis. This will reposition the square such that its new vertices
