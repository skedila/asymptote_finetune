You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The given Asymptote code generates a diagram featuring three overlapping ellipses arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with specific attention to their colors and intersections. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Ellipses**:
   - There are three ellipses, labeled as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - Ellipse \( A \) is centered at the point \((1, 0)\) and is a horizontally stretched circle with a major axis of length 4 (since it is scaled by a factor of 2 along the x-axis), and a minor axis of length 2 (since the unit circle has a radius of 1 before scaling).
   - Ellipse \( B \) is obtained by rotating ellipse \( A \) by 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin, making it vertically stretched and centered at \((0, 1)\).
   - Ellipse \( C \) is obtained by further
