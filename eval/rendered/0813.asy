You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 Consider a circle centered at the origin \( O = (0, 0) \) in the Cartesian coordinate plane. The circle has a radius of 4 centimeters. 

1. **Circle**: 
   - The circle is drawn with its center at the origin \( O \).
   - The radius of the circle is 4 cm.

2. **Point**:
   - A point is marked on the circumference of the circle.
   - This point is highlighted with a red color and is visually distinct due to its size, drawn with a thickness of 4 base points (bp).

Your task is to:
- Identify the coordinates of a point on the circumference of the circle, given that the circle is centered at the origin with a radius of 4 cm.
- Describe how the point might appear in terms of its location relative to the center and its visual distinction. 

This setup is suitable for problems involving the properties of circles, such as calculating the circumference, understanding the concept of
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

draw(circle(0,0,4cm),linewidth(0.5pt));
dot((4,0),red,bp=4bp);

/*
The point (4,0) lies on the circumference of the circle centered at the origin (0,0) with a radius of 4 cm.

The point is located 4 cm to the right of the center along the positive x-axis. It is visually distinct due to its size, which is emphasized by the thickness of 4 base points (bp). The red color of the dot makes it stand out against the background, which is typically black.
