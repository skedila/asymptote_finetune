 Consider a Cartesian coordinate system where we define several geometric entities and analyze their properties. The following description outlines the elements and calculations involved:

1. **Coordinate System and Points:**
   - We begin by defining a point \( A \) at coordinates \( (3.5, 0.75) \).
   - A second point \( B \) is determined by moving from \( A \) by a vector \( (\cos(0.5), \cos(1)) \).

2. **Labeling and Marking Points:**
   - Point \( A \) is labeled as \( A \) and marked with a dot positioned below it.
   - Point \( B \) is labeled as \( B \) and similarly marked.

3. **Arc and Circle:**
   - A circle is centered at \( A \) with a radius of 2 units.
   - An arc \( c \) is drawn on this circle from 45 degrees to 270 degrees in a
