 The diagram consists of a series of horizontal line segments, each 5 cm in length, with various arrow styles applied. The lines are positioned in a vertical sequence, each shifted horizontally by 6 cm from the origin along the x-axis. The y-coordinates of the lines start at 0 cm and decrease by 1 cm for each subsequent line, ranging from 0 cm to -7 cm. Below is a detailed description of each line and its corresponding arrow style:

1. **Line at (6 cm, 0 cm):** This line segment is drawn with an arrowhead at the end (right side) of the line. The arrowhead is styled using the default TeXHead.

2. **Line at (6 cm, -1 cm):** This line segment has an arrowhead at the beginning (left side) of the line.

3. **Line at (6 cm, -2 cm):** This line segment features an arrowhead in the middle.
