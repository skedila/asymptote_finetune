 Consider a mathematical diagram that involves a series of transformations applied to a simple geometric shape, producing a visually intriguing pattern:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - A circle with a radius of 10 units is drawn, centered at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - The circle is filled with a semi-transparent blue color (20% opacity).

2. **Division of Circle**:
   - The circle is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is a quarter-circle arc spanning 90 degrees.
   - These arcs are colored with varying shades:
     - The first quadrant (from 0 to 90 degrees) is colored in a semi-transparent red (\(80\%\) opacity).
     - The second quadrant (from 90 to 180 degrees) is colored in a semi-transparent green (\(70\%\) opacity).
     - The third quadrant (from 180 to 270 degrees) is colored in a combination of blue and grey, resulting in a blu

// Division of circle
draw(arc(0, 0, 10, 0, 90), fillcolor(red, 0.8));

draw(arc(0, 0, 10, 180, 270), fillcolor(blue + grey, 0.5));
draw(arc(0, 0, 10, 270, 360), fillcolor(blue + grey, 0.5));

// Rotate the entire diagram by 45 degrees
rotate(45);

// Scale the diagram by a factor of 2
scale(2);

// Translate the diagram 5 units to the right and 3 units up
translate(5, 3);
