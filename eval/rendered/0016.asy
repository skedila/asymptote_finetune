You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with visualizing a geometric scenario involving a circle and specific points on a coordinate plane. Follow the detailed instructions below to recreate the diagram:

1. **Circle**: Draw a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 4 units. This circle represents a scaled unit circle, where each unit on the circle has been multiplied by 4. The circle should be drawn with a standard line style.

2. **Points**: Identify and mark two significant points on your diagram:
   - The first point is the center of the circle, located at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - The second point lies on the positive x-axis, at \((4, 0)\). This point represents a point on the circumference of the circle along the x-axis.

3. **Background and Scaling**: The diagram should be set within a fixed coordinate system ranging from \((-8, -8)\) to \((6
