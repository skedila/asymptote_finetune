You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a mathematical diagram that illustrates the Taylor polynomial approximations of the cosine function. Here's a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Axes**: 
   - The diagram features a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis labeled as "$x$" and the y-axis labeled as "$y$".
   - The x-axis ranges from \(-2\pi\) to \(2\pi\), and the y-axis ranges from \(-4\) to \(4\).
   - Both axes are equipped with arrows to indicate their positive directions.

2. **Cosine Function**:
   - The graph of the cosine function, \(\cos(x)\), is drawn over the interval \([-2\pi, 2\pi]\).
   - This curve is rendered with a line width of 2bp (bold line) and is labeled with the legend "$\cos$".

3. **Taylor Polynomials**:
   - The diagram includes
