 You are presented with a coordinate geometry problem involving transformations and visual representation on a Cartesian plane. Consider the following setup:

1. **Coordinate System**: The primary coordinate system is a standard Cartesian plane with the x-axis and y-axis intersecting at the origin. The secondary coordinate system, denoted as \(O'\), is defined with its origin at the point \((0.5, 0.5)\) in the primary system. The basis vectors for this secondary system are \(\vec{u'} = (0.7, 0.7)\) and \(\vec{v'} = (-0.7, 0.7)\).

2. **Points in the Primary System**: 
   - Point \(A\) is located at coordinates \((0, 0.5)\).
   - Point \(B\) is located at coordinates \((1, 0.5)\).

3. **Point Representation**: 
   - Both points \(

// Points in the primary system
point A=(0,0.5);
point B=(1,0.5);

// Transformation from the primary system to the secondary system
point A'=A+0.5
