 The diagram consists of two hyperbolas, a set of intersection points, and tangent lines at those points. Here is a detailed description of the elements in the diagram:

1. **Point C**: The center of both hyperbolas is located at the origin, \( C = (0, 0) \). This point is marked with a dot.

2. **Hyperbolas**:
   - The first hyperbola, \( h_0 \), is centered at \( C \) with semi-major and semi-minor axes both equal to 2. This hyperbola is drawn in a red color with a line thickness of 2bp and 80% opacity.
   - The second hyperbola, \( h_1 \), also centered at \( C \), has a semi-major axis of 1.5 and a semi-minor axis of 1. This hyperbola is drawn in blue with the same line thickness and opacity as the first.

3. **Intersection
