 The diagram depicts a transformation of the unit circle under a specific homography. The following elements are present in the diagram:

1. **Unit Circle**: A circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 1 is drawn. This is the standard unit circle in the complex plane, represented by the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).

2. **Transformation**: A homography (or MÃ¶bius transformation) is applied to the points on the unit circle. The transformation is defined as:
   \[
   f(z) = \frac{z^2 + A}{z + 2}
   \]
   where \(A = 2e^{i\pi/2} = 2i\), placing \(A\) on the imaginary axis at the point \((0, 2)\).

3. **Dotted Lines**: For each point \(z\) on the unit circle,

size(10cm);

// Define the unit circle
draw(unitcircle, red);

// Define the homography
real A = 2*exp(i*pi/2);
real f(real z) {
    return (z^2 + A)/(z + 2);
}

// Draw the transformed points
for(real z = -1..1){
    real x = real(f(z));
    real y = imag(f(z));
    dot(x,y,red);
    line(x,y,0,0);
}

// Draw the dotted lines
for(real z = -1..1){
    real x = real(f(z));
    real y = imag(f(z));
    line(x,y,0,0);
}

// Draw the point A
dot(0,2,red);

// Draw the line from A to the origin
draw(A--(0,0),red);

// Draw the line from A to the point (1,0)
draw(A--(1,
