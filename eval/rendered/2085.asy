 The diagram consists of a series of ten overlapping rectangles arranged in a pattern that suggests rotation and scaling. Here is a step-by-step description of how the diagram is constructed:

1. **Base Rectangle**: The initial shape is a square (since the path `g` is defined as a box from `(-1, -1)` to `(1, 1)`), centered at the origin with vertices at `(-1, -1)`, `(1, -1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(-1, 1)`.

2. **Scaling and Rotation**:
   - The square is scaled by a factor of \( k = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{4} \).
   - The square is then rotated. The rotation angle is calculated using the formula \( \theta = \text{degrees}(\cos^{-1}(\frac{17}{16k\sqrt{2}})) \). This results in a specific angle that ensures the
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

path g = box((-1, -1), (1, 1));

real k = sqrt(10)/4;
real theta = degrees(acos(17/(16*k*sqrt(2))));

draw(g, scale(k)*rotate(theta));

for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    draw(g, scale(k*i)*rotate(theta*i));
}

draw(g, scale(k*10)*rotate(theta*10));

draw(g, scale(k*100)*rotate(theta*100));

draw(g, scale(k*1000)*rotate(theta*1000));

draw(g, scale(k*10000)*rotate(theta*10000));

draw(g, scale(k*100000)*rotate(theta*100000));

draw(g, scale(k*1000000)*
