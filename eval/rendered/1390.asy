 Consider a coordinate plane with two distinct circles and marked points. The diagram is constructed as follows:

1. **Coordinate System**: The coordinate system is transformed with basis vectors \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.25)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75)\), though this transformation is not visible in the final rendering.

2. **Points**:
   - Point \(A\) is located at coordinates \((-1, -1)\).
   - Point \(B\) is located at coordinates \((0.75, 0.5)\).

3. **Circles**:
   - Circle \(c_1\) is centered at point \(A\) with a radius of 1.5 units.
   - Circle \(c_2\) is centered at point \(B\) with a radius of 2 units.

4. **Intersection**:
   - The circles \(c_1

// Transformation of the coordinate system
real i = 1, j = 0.25;
real i_inv = 1/i, j_inv = 1/j;

// Points A and B
point A = (-1, -1);
point B = (0.75, 0.5);

// Circles c1 and c2
circle c1 = A + 1.5*dir(0);
circle c2 = B + 2*dir(0);

// Intersection point
point I = intersection(c1, c2);
