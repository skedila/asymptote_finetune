You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code renders a visual representation of a geometric plane in three-dimensional space, projected onto a two-dimensional view using an oblique projection. The specific elements of the visualization are as follows:

1. **Vectors and Point Definition**:
   - **Vector \( \mathbf{v_1} \)**: This is a vector extending from the origin in the positive x-direction, defined as \( (4, 0, 0) \).
   - **Vector \( \mathbf{v_2} \)**: This vector extends from the origin in the positive y-direction, defined as \( (0, 6, 0) \).
   - **Point \( \mathbf{p_0} \)**: This point serves as an anchor or a reference point for the plane, located at \( (-2, -3, 0) \).

2. **Plane Definition**:
   - A plane is defined using the vectors \( \mathbf{v_1
 import geometry;

// Define the vectors
vector v1 = (4, 0, 0);
vector v2 = (0, 6, 0);
point p0 = (-2, -3, 0);

// Define the plane using the vectors and point
plane P = plane(v1, v2, p0);

// Set the view to an oblique projection
view(oblique(1, 0, 0), 0, 0, 0);

// Draw the vectors and point
draw(v1, Arrow(ArrowHead=none, size=0.5cm));
draw(v2, Arrow(ArrowHead=none, size=0.5cm));
draw(p0, Arrow(ArrowHead=none, size=0.5cm));

// Draw the plane
draw(P, Arrow(ArrowHead=none, size=0.5cm));

// Label the vectors and point
label("$\mathbf{v_1}$", v1, S);
label("$\mathbf{v_2}$", v2, N);
