You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a complex diagram consisting of multiple rows of ellipses, with each row containing a symmetrical pattern of filled and outlined ellipses. Here is a detailed description of the visual output:

1. **Canvas Size and Background**: 
   - The diagram is set on a canvas with a size of 10 cm in width. The background of the entire canvas is filled with a light grey color.

2. **Ellipse Parameters**:
   - Each ellipse is centered at the origin (0,0) initially.
   - Ellipses have a semi-major axis length of `a = 1` and a semi-minor axis length of `b = 1.75`.
   - The ellipses are drawn using two paths: one for the upper half and one for the lower half.

3. **Visual Style**:
   - The upper half of each ellipse is drawn with a thick white outline (`1.5bp`).
   -
 import geometry;

size(10cm,0);

real a=1, b=1.75;

for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white,1.5bp);
    draw(ellipse(0,0,a,b),white
