You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a 3D diagram of a cylinder using orthographic projection. Here's a detailed description of the rendered image:

---

**Diagram Description:**

The diagram depicts a 3D cylinder with the following properties:

- **Cylinder Dimensions**: 
  - Radius \( R = 1 \)
  - Height \( H = 2 \)

- **Projection**: The cylinder is viewed under an orthographic projection from the direction (1, 1, 1), which gives a balanced view of the cylinder from the top, side, and front.

- **Cylinder Construction**:
  - The cylinder is constructed with 18 segments along its circular base, creating a polygonal approximation of a circle.

- **Visual Style**:
  - **Visible Edges**: The visible edges of the cylinder are drawn with a dotted line style, indicating they are not hidden by any part of the object.
  - **Hidden Edges**: The hidden edges
 ```asymptote
import three;

size(10cm,0);

// Cylinder dimensions
real R = 1;
real H = 2;

// Orthographic projection direction
point dir = (1,1,1);

// Cylinder construction
cylinder(R,H,dir);

// Visual style
visible(edge(color(blue,dot(1pt))));
hidden(edge(color(red,dot(1pt))));

// Axis
draw(dir,Arrow(0.2cm,red));

// Labels
label("$R=1$",(0,0,0.5),N);
label("$H=2$",(0,0,1.5),N);
label("$dir=(1,1,1)$",(0,0,2.5),N);
