You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a geometric diagram consisting of paths and lines with varying styles and colors. Follow the instructions below to replicate the diagram:

1. **Draw Two Thick Black Segments:**
   - Draw the first segment from point \(A = (0, 0)\) to point \(B = (1, 1)\). This segment should have a thickness of 5 millimeters and be colored black.
   - Draw the second segment from point \(C = (2, 0)\) to point \(D = (3, 1)\). This segment should also have a thickness of 5 millimeters and be colored black.

2. **Connect the Segments with a Blue Line:**
   - Draw a line connecting the endpoint \(B = (1, 1)\) of the first segment to the starting point \(C = (2, 0)\) of the second segment. This connecting line should have a thickness of 3 millimeters and be

// Draw the first segment
draw(A--B, thick(5mm), black);

// Draw the second segment
draw(C--D, thick(5mm), black);

// Connect the segments with a blue line
draw(B--C, thick(3mm), blue);
