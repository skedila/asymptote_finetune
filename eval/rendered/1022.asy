 Consider a sequence of six concentric circles, each with a radius of 3 cm. The circles are defined in a Cartesian coordinate system.

1. **Circle 1**: The first circle is centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) and is drawn with a bold red line of thickness 1 mm. This circle serves as the base reference for the subsequent circles.

2. **Circle 2**: The second circle is centered at \((1 \text{ mm}, 2 \text{ mm})\), which is a translation of 1 mm to the right and 2 mm upward from the origin. This circle is drawn with a standard line thickness and does not have a specified color, so it appears in the default black color.

3. **Circle 3**: The third circle is centered at \((2 \times 1 \text{ mm}, 2 \times 2 \text{ mm}) = (2 \text{ mm},
