You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are given a Cartesian coordinate system with a transformed basis. The transformation rotates the standard basis vectors by \( \frac{\pi}{8} \) radians counterclockwise and scales the \( x \)-axis by 1.5. In this coordinate system, consider the following geometric setup:

1. **Points A and B**: 
   - Point \( A \) is located at coordinates \((-1, -3)\).
   - Point \( B \) is located at coordinates \((5, 2)\).
   - These points are marked with labels \( A \) and \( B \) at the southeast and northwest positions, respectively.

2. **Line \( l_1 \)**:
   - A line \( l_1 \) is drawn through points \( A \) and \( B \).
   - This line is rendered in red.

3. **Point M**:
   - Point \( M \) is located at coordinates \((3, -3
