You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with constructing a geometric diagram based on the following detailed description:

1. **Coordinate System and Points**:
   - Consider a Cartesian coordinate system where points are defined in a plane.
   - Define point \( A \) at coordinates \((0.25, 0.25)\).
   - Define point \( B \) such that it is located at a vector addition from point \( A \), specifically at \((0.25 + 1, 0.25 + 0.25) = (1.25, 0.5)\).

2. **Visual Markings**:
   - Place a red dot labeled \( A \) at point \( A \), with the label positioned south of the point.
   - Place a red dot labeled \( B \) at point \( B \), with the label positioned north of the point.

3. **Segments and Lines**:
   - Draw a segment \( \overline{AB} \) between
 import geometry;

size(10cm,0);

point A=(0.25,0.25);
point B=(1.25,0.5);

draw(A--B,red);

dot(A,South);
dot(B,North);

label("$A$", A,S);
label("$B$", B,N);
