You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric diagram composed of several elements, described as follows:

1. **Triangle \( \triangle ABC \):**
   - The triangle is a right triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5 units. The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), with the hypotenuse being 5 units long.
   - This triangle is drawn with a standard line width and is labeled at a factor of 3, meaning the labels are positioned with some offset for clarity.

2. **Line \( l \):**
   - A straight line \( l \) is drawn from the point \((-1, -2)\) to the point \((1, 0.5)\).
   - This line is colored in red with a line width scaled by a factor of 0.8.

3. **Intersection Points:**
   - The points where the line \( l \) intersects the triangle \( \triangle
 import geometry;

draw(triangle(A, B, C), linewidth(3pt), label=("$A$", 3));
draw(triangle(A, B, C), linewidth(3pt), label=("$B$", 3));
draw(triangle(A, B, C), linewidth(3pt), label=("$C$", 3));

line l = line((-1,-2), (1,0.5));
draw(l, red, linewidth(0.8pt));

dot(l, A);
dot(l, B);
dot(l, C);

draw(l, linewidth(0.8pt));
draw(l, linewidth(0.8pt));
draw(l, linewidth(0.8pt));
