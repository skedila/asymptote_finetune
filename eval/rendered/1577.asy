 Consider a coordinate system with an origin at the point \((1, 2)\). The coordinate axes are defined by the vectors \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75)\). In this transformed coordinate system, we have the following geometric configuration:

1. **Point \(A\):** The point \(A\) is located at \((3.5, 0.5)\) in this coordinate system. It is marked with a red dot and labeled as \(A\) below the point.

2. **Circle and Arc \(C\):** A circle is centered at point \(A\) with a radius of \(2\). An arc \(C\) is drawn from \(60^\circ\) to \(270^\circ\) in a counterclockwise direction. This arc is displayed with an arrow indicating the direction of traversal.
