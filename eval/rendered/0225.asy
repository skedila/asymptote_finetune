You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric diagram described below. The diagram is set within a coordinate system, and specific elements are highlighted.

1. **Points and Path:**
   - Consider the point \( M \) at coordinates \( (1, 1) \).
   - The origin point is \( (0, 0) \).
   - A path \( g \) is drawn as a straight line segment from the origin to the point \( M \).

2. **Line:**
   - There is a line \( l \) that extends infinitely in both directions through the origin and point \( M \).

3. **Visual Properties:**
   - The line \( l \) is drawn with a very thick pen, specifically of width 5 mm.

4. **Points of Interest:**
   - A point \( N \) is located at \( (0.25, 0.28) \).
   - A point \( P \) is located at \( (
