You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a mathematical diagram constructed using specific points and curves. The diagram is created as follows:

1. **Points Definition**:
   - Point \( A \) is located at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Point \( B \) is at the coordinates \((3 \text{ cm}, 0.5 \text{ cm})\).
   - Point \( C \) is at \((6 \text{ cm}, 0)\).

2. **Curved Path**:
   - A smooth curve is drawn starting from point \( A \), passing through point \( B \), and ending at point \( C \).
   - At point \( A \), the curve is tangent to the north direction (upwards).
   - At point \( B \), the curve is tangent to the east direction (to the right).
   - At point \( C \), the curve is tangent to the south direction (downwards).
