 Consider a Cartesian coordinate system with an origin labeled \( O \) at the point \((2,1)\). The coordinate axes are given by the vectors \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.25)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.25, 0.75)\), indicating a skewed coordinate system rather than the standard orthogonal one.

Within this system, two points \( A \) and \( B \) are defined at coordinates \((1,1)\) and \((2,2)\), respectively. A line \( l_1 \) is drawn through these points, and it is labeled as \( (l_1) \).

Another line, \( l_2 \), is constructed by rotating line \( l_1 \) by \( 100^\circ \) around the point \((3,3)\). This line is also drawn and labeled as \( (l_2) \).
