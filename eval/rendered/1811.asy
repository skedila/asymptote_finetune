You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The diagram generated by the Asymptote code is a mathematical illustration featuring two distinct curves on a coordinate plane, along with specific points marked on one of the curves. Here is a detailed description of what the diagram represents:

1. **Coordinate Axes**:
   - The diagram includes a set of Cartesian axes with the x-axis labeled as "$x$" and the y-axis labeled as "$y$".
   - The x-axis spans from 0 to 1, and similarly, the y-axis spans from 0 to 1.
   - The x-axis includes regular tick marks, while the y-axis has ticks on both the left and right sides.

2. **First Curve**:
   - The first curve plotted is the function \( y = e^{-x^2} \), which is a Gaussian-like curve.
   - This curve is drawn over the interval \( x \in [0, 1] \).
   - The curve is labeled with the expression "$x
