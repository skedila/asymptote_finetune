You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The given Asymptote code generates a mathematical diagram involving a hyperbola and various labeled points and vectors. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Coordinate System**:
   - The diagram begins with a custom coordinate system `R` that is derived from a transformation of the standard Cartesian coordinate system. The basis vectors of this system are \(\vec{i} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\vec{j} = (-0.5, 0.75)\). This system is displayed but not directly visualized in the diagram.

2. **Hyperbola**:
   - A hyperbola is centered at the point \(C = (4, 2)\) in the transformed coordinate system. This point \(C\) is labeled as "C" and marked with a red dot positioned to the northwest of the point.
   - The hyperbola has semi-major axis length 2 and semi-minor axis length 1.5,

// Custom coordinate system R
R = (0,0) + (1,0.5) * 4 + (-0.5,0.75) * 2;

// Hyperbola centered at C
point C = (4,2);
hyperbola H = hyperbola(C, 2, 1.5);

// Labeled points
point A = H.point(0,0);
point B = H.point(1,0);
point D = H.point(0,1);
point E = H.point(1,1);
point F = H.point(0.5,0.5);
point G = H.point(0.5,1.5);
point H = H.point(1.5,0.5);
point I = H.point(1.5,1.5);

// Labeled vectors
vector v1 = A - C;
vector v2 = B - C;
vector v3 = D - C;
vector v4 = E - C;
