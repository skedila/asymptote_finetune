You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided is designed to generate a visual representation of a sequence of nested rectangles. Here is a detailed mathematical description of what the code visually renders:

---

**Problem Description:**

Consider a sequence of rectangles defined in the Cartesian plane. The initial rectangle, \( R_0 \), is defined by its vertices at the following coordinates:
- Lower-left corner: \( (0, 0) \)
- Lower-right corner: \( (1, 0) \)
- Upper-right corner: \( (1, 1) \)
- Upper-left corner: \( (0, 1) \)

This rectangle is a square with side length 1.

**Transformation and Iteration:**

We will perform a series of transformations on this initial rectangle. Specifically, we will generate a sequence of rectangles \( R_i \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, 10 \), where each rectangle \( R_{i+1} \
