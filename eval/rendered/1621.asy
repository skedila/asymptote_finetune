 Consider a Cartesian coordinate system with a custom basis. The origin of this system is at the point \( (1, 2) \) in the standard Cartesian plane. The basis vectors for this system are \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5) \) and \( \mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75) \).

In this system, we have the following geometric objects:

1. **Point \( A \)**: 
   - Located at coordinates \( (1, 1) \) in the custom coordinate system.
   - Marked with a red dot labeled "A" positioned to the south of the point.

2. **Point \( B \)**:
   - Positioned at \( (3, 2) \) in the custom coordinate system, calculated as \( A + (2, 1) \).
   - Marked with a blue dot labeled "B" positioned to the north of the point.
