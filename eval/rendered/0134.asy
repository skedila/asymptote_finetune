 Consider a set of points and curves in a two-dimensional plane, defined as follows:

1. **Points:**
   - Point \( A \) is located at the origin, with coordinates \( (0, 0) \).
   - Point \( B \) is at \( (3 \, \text{cm}, 5 \, \text{cm}) \).
   - Point \( C \) is at \( (6 \, \text{cm}, 0) \).

2. **Curves:**
   - **Curve 1:** A smooth curve passing through points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) is drawn using the default tension. This curve is depicted in black with a line thickness of 1 mm.
   - **Curve 2:** A grey curve is drawn from \( A \) to \( B \) to \( C \) with varying tension. The segment from \( A \) to \( B \) has
