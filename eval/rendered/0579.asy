 The diagram consists of a series of six cubic Bézier curves, each represented as a smooth path with different arrowhead styles along the curve. The paths and their styles are described below:

1. **Path Description**:
   - Each path is a cubic Bézier curve defined by the points \((0,0)\), \((2.5 \text{ cm}, 2.5 \text{ cm})\), and \((5 \text{ cm}, 0)\). This creates a smooth curve starting at the origin, peaking at the midpoint \((2.5 \text{ cm}, 2.5 \text{ cm})\), and ending at \((5 \text{ cm}, 0)\).

2. **First Column of Curves**:
   - **First Curve**: Positioned at the origin, \((0,0)\), with a standard arrowhead at the end of the curve.
   - **Second Curve**: Shifted
