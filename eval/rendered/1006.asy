You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a mathematical diagram consisting of a smooth curve and associated directional vectors. The diagram is constructed as follows:

1. **Curve Definition**: 
   - The primary feature of the diagram is a smooth curve defined in the Cartesian plane. 
   - The curve begins at the point \((3, 2)\) and ends at the point \((0, 2)\). It is parameterized such that it follows a reverse path.
   - The initial direction at the starting point \((3, 2)\) is at an angle of \(-50^\circ\) with respect to the positive x-axis.
   - The curve passes through the point \((1, 0)\) and smoothly connects these points using cubic BÃ©zier segments, with the direction at the endpoint \((0, 2)\) being \(10^\circ\) with respect to the positive x-axis.

2. **Visual Style**:
   - The curve is drawn with
 import geometry;

size(10cm,0);

path p = (3,2) -- (0,2);

draw(p,Arrow(ArrowStyle(Arrow(0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm)));

draw(p,Arrow(ArrowStyle(Arrow(0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm)));

draw(p,Arrow(ArrowStyle(Arrow(0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm)));

draw(p,Arrow(ArrowStyle(Arrow(0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm)));

draw(p,Arrow(ArrowStyle(Arrow(0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm)));

draw(p,Arrow(ArrowStyle(Arrow(0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm,0.5cm)));
