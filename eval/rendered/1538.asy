 The diagram consists of several geometric elements centered around a key point labeled \( A \) at coordinates \( (1, 1) \). The diagram is constructed using a non-standard coordinate system, but the description will refer to the standard Cartesian coordinates for clarity.

1. **Point \( A \):**
   - The point \( A \) is marked at coordinates \( (1, 1) \).
   - It is labeled with the text "A" positioned just south of the point.
   - The point is highlighted with a red dot of size 0.8.

2. **Primary Arc \( C \):**
   - An ellipse centered at \( A \) with a semi-major axis of length 4 (horizontal) and a semi-minor axis of length 2 (vertical) is considered.
   - The arc \( C \) is a section of this ellipse starting from an angle of 45 degrees to 180 degrees, measured counterclockwise from the positive x
