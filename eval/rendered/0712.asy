You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with interpreting a visual diagram that includes a specific labeled point. The diagram features a single point located at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system, which is denoted as \((0, 0)\).

This point is labeled with the mathematical expression \(\frac{\pi^2}{2}\). The label is presented in a larger font size, scaled by a factor of 5 for emphasis. The label is positioned such that it aligns to the east (right) of the point, ensuring that the text does not overlap with the point itself.

Your task is to analyze the diagram, considering the positioning and scaling of the label in relation to the point. Discuss the significance of the expression \(\frac{\pi^2}{2}\) in mathematical contexts, and explore potential reasons for its use in this diagram. Consider how the enhanced size and specific alignment of the label might affect the interpretation or emphasis of the diagram.
 In the given diagram, the point at the origin \((0, 0)\) is labeled with the mathematical expression \(\frac{\pi^2}{2}\). This expression is significant in various mathematical contexts. The number \(\pi\) (pi) is a fundamental constant in mathematics, representing the ratio of a circle'
