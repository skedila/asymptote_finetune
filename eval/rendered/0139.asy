You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are given a geometric diagram consisting of two concentric circles and their intersection points. The diagram is constructed as follows:

1. **Circle 1**: Draw a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 4 cm. This is the larger circle in the diagram.

2. **Circle 2**: Draw another circle, also centered at the origin, but with a smaller radius of 2 cm. This circle is entirely contained within the larger circle.

3. **Intersection Points**: Identify the points where the two circles intersect. Since the circles are concentric (sharing the same center), they do not intersect at any distinct points on the plane. Instead, the entire circumference of the smaller circle lies within the larger circle, and they only "intersect" in the sense that the smaller circle is a part of the larger one.

4. **Visual Representation**:
   - Both circles are drawn on the same plane, with the smaller circle appearing entirely inside the larger circle.
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

draw(circle(0, 0, 4cm), linewidth(0.5mm));
draw(circle(0, 0, 2cm), linewidth(0.5mm));

// Since the circles are concentric, there are no distinct intersection points.
// However, we can still visualize the smaller circle within the larger one.

// Draw a line from the center to the edge of the larger circle to represent the radius.
draw(0, 0, line(0, 4cm));

// Draw a line from the center to the edge of the smaller circle to represent its radius.
draw(0, 0, line(0, 2cm));

// Label the circles
label("$C_1$", (0, 4cm), N);
label("$C_2$", (0, 2cm), N);

// Label the radii
label("$r_1$", (0, 4cm), S);
label("$r_2$", (0, 2cm), S);

// Label the intersection points
