You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a diagram based on the following detailed description:

1. **Coordinate System**: 
   - The diagram is set in a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin translated to the point \((1, 2)\). The basis vectors are defined as \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75)\). However, this coordinate system is not explicitly shown in the final diagram.

2. **Point**:
   - A point \( A \) is located at the coordinate \((1, 1)\) within the translated coordinate system. It is marked with a red dot and labeled as \( A \) below the point.

3. **Arcs**:
   - **Arc \( C \)**:
     - Construct an ellipse centered at \( A \) with a semi-major axis of length 4 (horizontal) and a semi-minor axis of length

// Point A
point A = (1,1);
dot(A, red);
label("$A$", A, S);

// Arc C
arc C = ellipse(A, 4, 2);
draw(C, red);

// Arc D
arc D = ellipse(A, 2, 4);
draw(D, red);

// Arc E
arc E = ellipse(A, 2, 2);
draw(E, red);

// Arc F
arc F = ellipse(A, 4, 4
