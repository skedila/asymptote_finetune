You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The problem involves understanding and analyzing a mathematical graph that has been customized with specific axis limits and tick mark styles. 

You are provided with a horizontal axis (x-axis) that spans from \(-3\pi\) to \(3\pi\). The axis is drawn in a way that both the bottom and top parts are visible. The axis is marked with ticks at regular intervals, and these ticks have specific properties:

1. **Major Ticks**: The major ticks occur at every \(2\pi\) interval. These are labeled with their exact values using the format "$%.2f$", meaning each label will display the value as a floating-point number with two decimal places. The labels are colored in red.

2. **Minor Ticks**: Between each pair of major ticks, there are minor ticks placed at every \(\frac{\pi}{5}\) interval. These minor ticks are not labeled, but they are styled with a shorter length and are colored red as well
