You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a diagram that consists of a smoothly connected path and several marked points and segments. The diagram is defined as follows:

1. **Path Definition:**
   - The path, denoted as \( \gamma \), is a cubic BÃ©zier curve. It starts at the point \( (0,0) \), moves through the control point \( (1,1) \), and ends at the point \( (2,-1) \).
   - The path is influenced by a direction constraint at the endpoint \( (2,-1) \) which is specified as \( \text{dir}(-90) \), meaning the tangent at this point is directed vertically downwards.

2. **Path Rendering:**
   - The entire path \( \gamma \) is drawn in the diagram.

3. **Special Points:**
   - The initial point of the path \( \gamma(0) = (0,0) \), the intermediate control point \( \
