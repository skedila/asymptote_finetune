You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The given Asymptote code generates a series of curved paths with different arrowhead styles and positions. The diagram consists of several parts, each described as follows:

1. **Curved Path with Arc Arrow**: 
   - A smooth, cubic Bézier curve starts at the point \((0, 0)\), peaks at the point \((2.5 \text{ cm}, 2.5 \text{ cm})\), and ends at the point \((5 \text{ cm}, 0)\).
   - This curve is drawn with an arrowhead at the end, styled as a "hook" head.

2. **Vertically Shifted Curved Paths with Various Arrowhead Positions**:
   - The same cubic Bézier curve is repeated three more times, each shifted vertically downwards:
     - The first repetition is shifted to start at \((0, -2 \text{ cm})\).
     - The second repetition begins at \((0
