 The diagram consists of two main curves: a circle and a cubic Bezier curve, along with two tangent lines, each drawn at specific points on these curves.

1. **Circle**:
   - The circle, denoted as \( \mathcal{C} \), is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a radius of 1 unit. This is a standard unit circle in the Cartesian plane.

2. **Cubic Bezier Curve**:
   - The curve begins at the point \((1.5, 2)\) and ends at \((3.5, 2)\).
   - It passes through the control point \((2.5, 0)\).
   - The tangent direction at the starting point \((1.5, 2)\) is \(-60^\circ\) relative to the positive x-axis, and at the ending point \((3.5, 2)\), it is \(60^\circ
