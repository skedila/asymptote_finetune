 The diagram consists of several geometric elements in a custom coordinate system. Here's a detailed description of the visual elements:

1. **Coordinate System**: The diagram is drawn in a custom Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at point \((2, 1)\). The basis vectors are \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.25, 0.75)\). The axes are not standard and are instead skewed according to these basis vectors.

2. **Point**: The point \(A\) is located at coordinates \((1, 1)\) in this custom coordinate system. This point is labeled with the letter \(A\) and is marked with a red dot positioned below the point (South).

3. **Circle \(C\)**: A circle centered at point \(A\) with a radius \(R = 2\) is drawn. This circle is represented with an arrow indicating

// Define the custom coordinate system
point i = (1, 0.5);
point j = (-0.25, 0.75);

// Draw the coordinate axes
draw(i, 2cm, Arrow(TeX));
draw(j, 2cm, Arrow(TeX));

// Label the origin
dot((2, 1), red);
label("(2, 1)", (2, 1), S);

// Draw the point A
point A = (1, 1);
dot(A, red);
label("A", A, S);

// Draw the circle C
circle(A, 2cm, Arrow(TeX));
