You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a parametric curve consisting of two segments and understanding the distinction between its arc length and its parameterized length. The curve is defined by the following details:

1. **Curve Definition**: The curve, denoted as \( p \), is composed of two segments:
   - The first segment is a quadratic BÃ©zier curve starting at the point \((0,0)\) and passing through the control point \((1,1)\).
   - The second segment continues to the point \((2,0.5)\) and is tangent to the horizontal direction at the endpoint.

2. **Curve Properties**:
   - The total arc length of the curve, denoted as \( \text{arclength}(p) \), is calculated.
   - The parameterized length of the curve, denoted as \( \text{length}(p) \), is also determined.

3. **Key Points**:
   - A point is identified at the
 import geometry;

// Define the first segment of the curve
path p1 = (0,0) .. (1,1) .. (2,0.5);

// Define the second segment of the curve
path p2 = (2,0.5) .. (2,0);

// Combine the two segments to form the complete curve
path p = p1 + p2;

// Calculate the arc length of the curve
real arclength = arclength(p);

// Calculate the parameterized length of the curve
real length = length(p);

// Output the results
print("Arc length of the curve: $arclength\n");
print("Parameterized length of the curve: $length\n");

// Plot the curve
draw(p, currentpen);

// Mark the key points on the curve
dot(p1, (0,0));
dot(p2, (2,0.5));

// Label the key points
label("(0,0)", p1, S);
label("(2,0.5)", p2, S);

// Show the
