 Consider a horizontal line segment drawn on a plane. The endpoints of this line segment are labeled as points \( A \) and \( B \).

- Point \( A \) is located at the origin with coordinates \( (0, 0) \).
- Point \( B \) is located 6 centimeters to the right of point \( A \) along the x-axis, with coordinates \( (6, 0) \).

The line segment \( \overline{AB} \) is drawn with a smooth curve that begins at point \( A \) and ends at point \( B \). The initial direction of the curve at point \( A \) is vertically upwards (North), and the final direction of the curve as it approaches point \( B \) is horizontally to the right (East).

Additionally, both points \( A \) and \( B \) are marked with dots to indicate their positions on the plane. The curve smoothly transitions from the upward direction at \( A \)
