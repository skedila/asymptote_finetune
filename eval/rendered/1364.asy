 Consider a Cartesian coordinate plane. On this plane, we have the following elements:

1. **Points**:
   - Point \( A \) is located at the coordinates \((-1, -1)\). This point is marked with a red dot and labeled as \( A \) positioned to the south of the point.
   - Point \( B \) is located at the coordinates \( (2, 1) \). This point is also marked with a red dot and labeled as \( B \) positioned to the north of the point.
   - Point \( F \) is located at the coordinates \( (2, -1.5) \). This point is marked with a dot and labeled as \( F \) positioned to the north of the point.

2. **Line**:
   - A straight line \( l \) is drawn through points \( A \) and \( B \). This line represents the linear equation passing through these two points.

3. **Parab
