You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code generates a three-dimensional diagram consisting of two rectangular prisms (slabs) and a cylinder, each with specific dimensions and positions. The scene is rendered with a perspective projection from a distant viewpoint, providing a sense of depth and spatial arrangement. The objects are distinguished by color and transparency to enhance visual clarity.

### Description of the Diagram:

1. **Rectangular Prism 1 (Red Slab):**
   - **Dimensions:** The first rectangular prism has a length of 180 units, a width of 30 units, and a height of 3 units.
   - **Position:** It is positioned such that its center is shifted by \(-15\) units along the \(Y\)-axis, \(-1.5\) units along the \(Z\)-axis, and \(65\) units along the \(X\)-axis.
   - **Appearance:** This slab is rendered with a semi-transparent red color (35% opacity).

 ```asymptote
import three;

// Define the color and opacity for the red slab
fillcolor(red, 0.35);

// Create the first rectangular prism (red slab)
