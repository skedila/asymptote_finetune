 The diagram consists of a series of curved paths, each represented by a cubic Bezier curve, and each adorned with different arrow styles. There are two columns of curves, each containing four distinct curves. The curves are positioned as follows:

1. **Column 1 (Left Column):**
   - **Curve 1:** A cubic Bezier curve starting at the point \((0, 0)\), passing through the control point \((2.5 \text{ cm}, 2.5 \text{ cm})\), and ending at the point \((5 \text{ cm}, 0)\). This curve is drawn with an arrow at the end, styled as an "ArcArrow."
   - **Curve 2:** A translation of Curve 1, shifted vertically downward by 2 cm to start at \((0, -2 \text{ cm})\) and end at \((5 \text{ cm}, -2 \text{ cm})\).
