 Consider a Cartesian coordinate plane. On this plane, we have two distinct points labeled \( A \) and \( B \). The point \( A \) is located at coordinates \((-1, -1)\), and the point \( B \) is located at coordinates \((0.75, 0.5)\). These points are marked in red, with \( A \) labeled to the northwest and \( B \) labeled directly to the north.

Two circles are drawn on this plane. The first circle, \( c_1 \), is centered at point \( A \) with a radius of 1.5 units. The second circle, \( c_2 \), is centered at point \( B \) with a radius of 2 units. These circles are drawn such that they intersect at two distinct points.

The intersection points of the circles are labeled as \( M \) and \( N \). The point \( M \) is labeled in red and positioned to the
