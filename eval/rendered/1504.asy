 Consider a coordinate system that has been transformed such that the basis vectors are \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5) \) and \( \mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75) \). In this transformed system, we are working within a bounding box defined by the corners \((0, 0.5)\) and \((5, 4)\).

1. **Point and Label:**
   - There is a point labeled \( C \) located at the coordinates \((3, 2)\) in the transformed coordinate system. This point is marked with a red dot and labeled above it.

2. **Hyperbola:**
   - A hyperbola is centered at point \( C \) with semi-major axis length \( a = 1 \) and semi-minor axis length \( b = 2 \). The hyperbola is drawn within the bounding box from \((0, 0.5)\)

// Transformation matrix
matrix M = (1, 0.5) * (-0.5, 0.75);

// Bounding box
draw(box((0, 0.5), (5, 4)), linewidth(0.5pt));

// Point C
point C = (3, 2);
draw(C, red, label("$C$", N));

// Hyperbola
hyperbola(C, 1, 2);
