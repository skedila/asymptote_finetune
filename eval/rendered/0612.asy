You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a diagram consisting of four horizontal lines, each with different arrow styles, positioned vertically in sequence. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Line 1:**
   - A horizontal line segment is drawn from the point \((0, 0)\) to \((5, 0)\).
   - This line has an arrowhead at the end, positioned at the 75% mark along the line, i.e., at the point \((3.75, 0)\).
   - The arrowhead is styled with a size of 20 base points (bp).

2. **Line 2:**
   - A second horizontal line segment is drawn from \((0, -2)\) to \((5, -2)\), which is a vertical shift of 2 units downward from the first line.
   - This line also has an arrowhead at the 75% mark, positioned at \((3
