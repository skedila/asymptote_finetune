You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric diagram based on the following description:

1. **Coordinates and Points:**
   - Three points are defined in the Cartesian coordinate system:
     - Point \( A \) is located at coordinates \((-1, 0)\).
     - Point \( B \) is located at coordinates \( (3, -1) \).
     - Point \( C \) is located at coordinates \( (0, 1) \).

2. **Circle Construction:**
   - A circle is constructed such that it passes through all three points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). This circle is denoted as \( \circle(A, B, C) \).
   - The circle is drawn with a bold line, having a line width of 2 millimeters.

3. **Arcs:**
   - An arc from point \( A \) to point \( B \) along the circle is highlighted in red. This arc is drawn
