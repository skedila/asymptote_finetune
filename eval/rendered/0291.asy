 Consider a coordinate plane with a Cartesian coordinate system centered at the point \((1, 2)\). The basis vectors for this coordinate system are \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75)\). 

In this setup, we have the following elements:

1. **Point \(A\)**: Plotted at the coordinates \((3.5, 1.5)\) on the Cartesian plane. This point is labeled as \(A\) and marked with a red dot, placed to the south of the label.

2. **Circle and Arc**: A circle is centered at point \(A\) with a radius \(R = 2\). From this circle, an arc \(C\) is drawn starting at an angle of \(45^\circ\) and ending at \(270^\circ\), measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. This

// Define the center of the coordinate system
point center = (1, 2);

// Define the basis vectors
vector i = (1, 0.5);
vector j = (-0.5, 0.75);

// Define the point A
point A = (3.5, 1.5);

// Draw the Cartesian coordinate system
draw(center, i, j, Arrow(4cm, 0.5cm));

// Draw the point A
dot(A, red);
label("$A$", A, S);

// Draw the circle centered at A with radius 2
draw(circle(A, 2), Arrow(4cm, 0.5cm));

// Draw the arc C starting at 45 degrees and ending at 270 degrees
arc(A, 2, 45, 270, 0, 180);

// Label the arc C
label("$C$", A + 0.5*i, S);
