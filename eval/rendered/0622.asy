 Consider a horizontal line segment defined on the Cartesian plane. The following transformations and styles are applied to this line segment:

1. **Original Line Segment**: Begin with a horizontal line segment from the point \((0,0)\) to the point \((5,0)\). This line is drawn with a bar at both ends, indicating the endpoints are emphasized with perpendicular short lines.

2. **First Transformed Line Segment**: Apply a vertical downward shift by 1 unit to the original line segment. This results in a new line segment from \((0,-1)\) to \((5,-1)\). This line is drawn with a bar at the beginning (left endpoint), indicating this endpoint is emphasized with a perpendicular short line.

3. **Second Transformed Line Segment**: Apply a further vertical downward shift by 1 unit to the first transformed line segment. This results in a line segment from \((0,-2)\) to \((5,-2)\).
