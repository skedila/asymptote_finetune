You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a series of horizontal line segments on a coordinate plane, each extending from the origin along the x-axis. The lines are styled with arrows of various types and positions. Here are the specific instructions for each line:

1. **First Line:**
   - Draw a horizontal line segment from the point \((0, 0)\) to \((5, 0)\).
   - Place an arrowhead at the end of the line segment at \((5, 0)\).
   - The arrowhead is styled with a base size of 20bp and is positioned at 75% of the way along the line segment, pointing towards the end of the line.

2. **Second Line:**
   - Draw a horizontal line segment, shifted vertically downward by 2 units, from \((0, -2)\) to \((5, -2)\).
   - Place an arrowhead at the end of the line segment at \((5,
