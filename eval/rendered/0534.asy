You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with constructing a geometric diagram based on the following description:

1. **Vertices and Triangle Construction:**
   - Identify three points in the Cartesian plane: \( A = (0, 0) \), \( B = (1, 0) \), and \( C = (0, 1) \).
   - Construct a triangle by connecting these points in sequence: \( A \) to \( B \), \( B \) to \( C \), and \( C \) back to \( A \). This forms a right triangle with \( AB \) as the base, \( AC \) as the height, and \( \angle A \) being the right angle.

2. **Styling the Triangle:**
   - The triangle is outlined using solid lines, creating a closed triangular shape.

3. **Highlighting the Base:**
   - Emphasize the line segment \( AB \) using a distinct color blend. Specifically, draw the segment \(
 import geometry;

size(10cm);

// Define the vertices of the triangle
point A = (0, 0);
point B = (1, 0);
point C = (0, 1);

// Construct the triangle
draw(A--B--C--cycle, linewidth(1pt));

// Highlight the base AB with a color blend
draw(A--B, red+blue, linewidth(2pt));

// Label the vertices
label("$A$", A, SW);
label("$B$", B, SE);
label("$C$", C, NW);

// Add a coordinate system
draw(A--B--C--cycle, linewidth(1pt));
draw(A--(0,1), linewidth(1pt));
draw(B--(1,0), linewidth(1pt));
draw(C--(0,0), linewidth(1pt));

// Add a label for the base
label("$AB$", (A+B)/2, S);
