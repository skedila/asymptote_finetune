 Consider a coordinate plane with the following elements:

1. **Points and Coordinates**:
   - Point \( A \) is located at \( (0, -0.5) \).
   - Point \( B \) is determined by moving from point \( A \) in the direction of \( 45^\circ \) with an unspecified distance. This places \( B \) at a position that is a linear combination of \( A \) and the direction vector.

2. **Circle**:
   - The center of the circle, point \( C \), is at the coordinates \((0, 1)\). From this point, move in the direction of \( 20^\circ \) with a magnitude of 2 units to determine the center \( C \) of the circle.
   - The circle is of unit radius and is centered at this calculated position \( C \).

3. **Intersections**:
   - Calculate the intersection points between the line extending from \( A
