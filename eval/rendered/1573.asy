 The diagram is set in a customized Cartesian coordinate system, where the origin has been shifted to the point \((1, 2)\) and the basis vectors are \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5) \) and \( \mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75) \). This coordinate transformation is not directly visible but affects the interpretation of coordinates.

1. **Point A**: The point \( A \) is located at \((3.5, 0.5)\) in the transformed coordinate system. It is marked with a red dot and labeled as \( "A" \) positioned to the southwest (SW) of the dot.

2. **Ellipse and Arc**: An ellipse is centered at point \( A \) with a semi-major axis of length 2 and a semi-minor axis of length 1, rotated by \(-30^\circ\) from the horizontal axis. An arc \( C

// Define the shifted origin
point O = (1, 2);

// Define the transformed basis vectors
vector i = (1, 0.5);
vector j = (-0.5, 0.75);

// Define the point A
point A = (3.5, 0.5);

// Draw the ellipse centered at A
draw(ellipse(A, 2, 1, -30));

// Draw the arc C
arc(A, 2, 1, -30, 0, 180);

// Mark the point A with a red dot
dot(A, red);

// Label the point A
label("$A$", A, SW);

// Draw the basis vectors
draw(i, Arrow(ArrowArrow(0.5mm)));
draw(j, Arrow(ArrowArrow(0.5mm)));

// Label the basis vectors
label("$\mathbf{i}$", O + i, S);
label("$\mathbf{j}$", O + j
