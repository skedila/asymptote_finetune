 Consider a smooth parametric curve defined by the path \((0,0) \to (1,1) \to (2,0.5)\) with a specified direction at the endpoint. The curve begins at the origin \((0,0)\), passes through the point \((1,1)\), and ends at \((2,0.5)\) with a tangent direction parallel to the x-axis at the endpoint. The curve is constructed using a cubic Bezier spline.

The total length of this path is divided into 15 equal segments. Each segment of the curve is drawn individually with a distinct color gradient. The color of each segment transitions smoothly from red at the start of the path to blue at the end. Specifically, the color of a segment at position \(i\) along the path is determined by the linear interpolation \( \frac{i}{l} \cdot \text{red} + \frac{l-i}{l} \cdot \
