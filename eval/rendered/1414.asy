You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a detailed geometric diagram based on the following specifications:

1. **Coordinate System**: Use a custom Cartesian coordinate system defined by the origin at point \((0,0)\), with basis vectors \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5) \) and \( \mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75) \). Do not display the axes.

2. **Points**:
   - Define point \( A \) at coordinates \((2.5, -1)\) within this coordinate system.
   - Define point \( B \) such that \( \overrightarrow{AB} = (3, 1) \). Therefore, point \( B \) is located at \((5.5, 0)\).

3. **Labels**:
   - Label point \( A \) as \( A \), positioned to the southwest of the point.
   - Label point \( B \) as \(
