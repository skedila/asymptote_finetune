 Consider a geometric diagram consisting of two distinct paths and their connections. 

1. **Path Descriptions:**
   - **Path \( p_1 \):** This is a line segment starting at the point \( (0,0) \) and ending at the point \( (1,1) \). This path is drawn with a bold line having a thickness of 5 millimeters.
   
   - **Path \( p_2 \):** This is another line segment starting at the point \( (2,0) \) and ending at the point \( (3,1) \). Similarly, this path is drawn with a bold line of thickness 5 millimeters.

2. **Connections Between Paths:**
   - **Direct Connection:** A line segment is drawn connecting the endpoint of \( p_1 \) at \( (1,1) \) to the starting point of \( p_2 \) at \( (2,0) \). This connecting line
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

path p1 = line((0,0), (1,1));
path p2 = line((2,0), (3,1));

draw(p1, linewidth(5mm), line(p1, p2));
draw(p2, linewidth(5mm));

draw(p1, linewidth(5mm));
draw(p2, linewidth(5mm));
```
