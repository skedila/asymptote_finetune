You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric diagram that involves a transformed circle and a gradient shading effect. The diagram is constructed as follows:

1. **Coordinate System and Scaling:**
   - Begin with a unit circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Apply a horizontal scaling transformation to this circle, stretching it by a factor of 1.25 along the x-axis. This results in an ellipse centered at the origin, with the major axis along the x-axis and the minor axis along the y-axis.

2. **Key Points on the Ellipse:**
   - Identify the point \( A \) on the ellipse corresponding to the direction \( 135^\circ \). After applying the horizontal scaling transformation, this point \( A \) is located at approximately \((-0.8839, 0.8839)\).
   - Identify the point \( B \) on the ellipse corresponding to the direction \(-45^\circ\). After transformation, this point
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

draw(unitcircle, linewidth(1pt));

// Apply horizontal scaling transformation
draw(scale(1.25,1) unitcircle, linewidth(1pt));

// Calculate the coordinates of point A
point A = 135*degrees*unitcircle;

// Calculate the coordinates of point B
point B = -45*degrees*unitcircle;

// Draw the ellipse
draw(scale(1.25,1) unitcircle, linewidth(1pt));

// Draw the points A and B
dot(A, red);
dot(B, red);

// Draw the line segment from the origin to point A
draw(A--(0,0), red);

// Draw the line segment from the origin to point B
draw(B--(0,0), red);

// Draw the line segment from point A to point B
draw(A--B, red);

// Apply gradient shading effect
shade(A--B, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5
