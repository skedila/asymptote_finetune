You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a diagram that consists of a unit circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\). The diagram includes two distinct paths drawn on this circle, both annotated with arrows and visual markers indicating direction.

1. **Circle Definition**:
   - The circle has a radius of 1 and is centered at the origin \((0, 0)\). This is the standard unit circle in the Cartesian plane.

2. **Path Descriptions**:
   - **First Path**: 
     - This path is the reverse of the standard unit circle, meaning it is traced in a clockwise direction.
     - The path is drawn with an arrow indicating its direction. The arrow is placed approximately 10% along the length of the path from the starting point, which is at the top of the circle \((0, 1)\).
     - The path begins with a visual marker (a bar) at its starting point.
   
   - **Second Path**:
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

draw(unitcircle, Arrow(ArrowHead=none, length=0.1cm));
draw(unitcircle, Arrow(ArrowHead=angle(180), length=0.1cm));
draw(unitcircle, Arrow(ArrowHead=angle(0), length=0.1cm));

draw(unitcircle, Arrow(ArrowHead=angle(180), length=0.1cm, bar(0, 1cm)));
draw(unitcircle, Arrow(ArrowHead=angle(0), length=0.1cm, bar(0, 1cm)));
```
