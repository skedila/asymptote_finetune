You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code generates a mathematical diagram that illustrates the interpolation of a Hermite polynomial through a set of points derived from the sine function. The diagram contains the following elements:

1. **Coordinate Axes**: 
   - The diagram includes a set of Cartesian axes with the x-axis labeled as "$x$" and the y-axis labeled as "$y$".
   - The x-axis ranges from $-2\pi$ to $2\pi$, and the y-axis ranges from $-2$ to $2$.
   - Both axes feature tick marks for reference.

2. **Discrete Points**: 
   - Five points are plotted on the graph, each represented by a thick dot (with a line width of 2mm).
   - These points are calculated as follows:
     - The x-coordinates are evenly spaced between $-2\pi$ and $2\pi$, excluding the endpoints.
     - The y-coordinates are given by the sine
