You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 This Asymptote code generates a visually striking diagram composed of concentric circles and a series of colored sectors, akin to a color wheel. Here's a detailed description of the diagram it produces:

1. **Concentric Circles**: The diagram features two concentric circles centered at the origin (0,0).
   - The inner circle has a radius of \( r = 1 \).
   - The outer circle has a radius of \( R = 3.8 \).

2. **Sector Construction**: The space between the two circles is divided into 12 equal sectors, each spanning 30 degrees. This is achieved by rotating a defined arc path and filling the resulting sector with a gradient of color.
   - Each sector is constructed by:
     - An arc on the inner circle from 0 to 30 degrees.
     - An arc on the outer circle from 30 to 0 degrees (in reverse order).
     - A transformation is applied to rotate these arcs by

}
