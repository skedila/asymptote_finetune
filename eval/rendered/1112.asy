You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a mathematical diagram involving a curve and some associated text. Follow these instructions to replicate the visual representation:

1. **Coordinate System and Scaling**: 
   - Establish a coordinate system where 1 unit corresponds to 4 centimeters in real-world measurement.

2. **Path Definition**:
   - Construct a smooth curve (path) that begins at the point \((0,0)\).
   - The curve passes through the point \((1,1)\).
   - It continues to the point \((2,0.5)\).
   - At the endpoint \((2,0.5)\), the direction of the path is tangent to the horizontal axis, i.e., it is directed towards the positive x-axis.

3. **Text Placement**:
   - Place the text “A text along a curve” along the entire length of the defined path.
   - The text should be in a significantly large font size, indicated by the command `\Huge
 import geometry;

size(10cm);

path p = (0,0) .. (1,1) .. (2,0.5);

draw(p, currentpen);

draw(p, currentpen, currentcolor);

text(p, \Huge "A text along a curve", currentpen);

draw(p, currentpen, currentcolor);
