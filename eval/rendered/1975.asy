You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 This Asymptote code generates a visually striking diagram consisting of two concentric ellipses and a background, with a shading effect between the ellipses. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Background**: The entire diagram is set on a filled square background. The background is an 8x8 unit square, centered at the origin, and shifted by (-0.5, -0.5) to ensure it covers the region from (-4, -4) to (4, 4). This background is filled with a solid blue color.

2. **Ellipses**:
   - Two ellipses are drawn, both derived from the unit circle but transformed.
   - The first ellipse, `c1`, is created by first rotating the unit circle by 15 degrees counterclockwise and then scaling it horizontally by a factor of 1.1. This transformation results in an ellipse with a semi-major axis of 1.1 units
