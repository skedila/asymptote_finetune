 In this mathematical diagram, we are working within a 10 cm by 10 cm Cartesian coordinate system. The diagram features several geometric elements, including points, lines, and a parabola, with specific annotations and styles.

1. **Points:**
   - Point \( A \) is located at coordinates \((-1, -1)\). It is marked with a red dot and labeled as \( A \) below the point.
   - Point \( B \) is located at coordinates \((2, 1)\). It is marked with a red dot and labeled as \( B \) to the northwest of the point.
   - Point \( F \) is located at coordinates \((2, -1.5)\). It is marked with a red dot and labeled as \( F \) above the point.

2. **Lines:**
   - A line \( l \) is drawn passing through points \( A \) and \( B \). This line is solid.
