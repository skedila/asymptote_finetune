 The diagram consists of the following elements:

1. **Point \( A \)**: This is labeled as \( A \) and is located at the coordinates \( (2.5, -1) \). The label is positioned to the southwest of the point.

2. **Ellipse \( el1 \)**: An ellipse centered at point \( A \). It has a semi-major axis of length 2 and a semi-minor axis of length 1. The ellipse is rotated by 10 degrees counterclockwise from the horizontal axis. The ellipse is drawn in a standard line style.

3. **Circle \( C \)**: A circle centered at point \( A \) with a radius of 3 units. This circle is drawn with a standard line style.

4. **Points \( B \)**: There are four points labeled as \( B \) located on the circumference of circle \( C \). These points correspond to the angles 0, 90, 180, and
