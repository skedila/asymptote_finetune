 Consider a geometric diagram centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) on the Cartesian plane. The diagram consists of the following elements:

1. **Circle**: A circle is drawn with a radius of 4 centimeters, centered at the origin. This circle is referred to as \( C \).

2. **Radial Lines**: From the center of the circle \((0, 0)\), draw radial lines to points on the circumference of the circle. These radial lines are drawn as dotted lines.

3. **Points on the Circle**: Points are marked along the circumference of the circle \( C \). These points are spaced at regular intervals of 0.2 units along the path of the circle, starting from an arbitrary point on the circle and continuing around until the entire circumference is covered.

The result is a circle with evenly spaced dots along its circumference, each connected to the center by a dotted line, creating a starburst pattern emanating from the origin. The
