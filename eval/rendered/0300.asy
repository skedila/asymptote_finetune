 Consider a Cartesian coordinate system with a custom basis defined by the vectors \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5) \) and \( \mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75) \). Within this coordinate system, we define two key points:

- Point \( A \) is located at \( (1, 1) \).
- Point \( B \) is located at \( (3, 2) \).

Both points are marked with colored labels: \( A \) is labeled in red below the point, and \( B \) is labeled in blue above the point.

Two circles, each with a radius of 2 units, are centered at points \( A \) and \( B \), respectively. From these circles, we define two arcs:

1. Arc \( a \) is part of the circle centered at \( A \) and spans from \(-40^\circ\) to \(180^\circ\).

// Define the custom basis vectors
pair i = (1, 0.5);
pair j = (-0.5, 0.75);

// Define the points A and B
pair A = (1, 1);
pair B = (3, 2);

// Draw the circles centered at A and B with radius 2
draw(circle(A, 2), red);
draw(circle(B, 2), blue);

// Label the points A and B
label("$A$", A, S);
label("$B$", B, N);

// Define the arc a
arc a = arc(A, 2, -40, 180);

// Draw the arc a
draw(a);

// Label the arc a
label("$a$", a, S);
