 Consider a geometric configuration in the Cartesian plane involving points, lines, and parallel lines. The setup is as follows:

1. **Points and Triangle Construction**:
   - Define points \( A = (0, 0) \), \( B = (1, 0) \), and \( C = (0.7, 0.7) \).
   - Construct triangle \( \triangle ABC \) by drawing the following line segments:
     - Line segment \( AB \) is drawn in red with thickness 0.8.
     - Line segment \( AC \) is drawn in green with thickness 0.8.
     - Line segment \( BC \) is drawn in blue with thickness 0.8.

2. **Labeling**:
   - Label point \( A \) at the coordinates \( (0, 0) \) with the label \( A \) positioned to the southwest.
   - Label point \( B \) at the coordinates \( (
