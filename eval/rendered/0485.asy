You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with visualizing a mathematical diagram based on the following detailed description:

1. **Circle**: Draw a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 4 units. This circle should be scaled proportionally, maintaining its circular shape.

2. **Points**:
   - Mark a point at the origin \((0, 0)\). This point represents the center of the circle.
   - Mark another point at the coordinates \((4, 0)\). This point lies on the circumference of the circle along the positive x-axis.

3. **Viewing Window**: Set the viewing window to a fixed scale that spans from \((-8, -8)\) to \((6, 6)\). This ensures that the entire circle and the marked points are visible within this bounded region.

4. **Background**: Fill the entire viewing window with a light grey color, providing a contrasting background for the circle and the points.
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

draw(circle((0,0),4),scale=1);
dot((0,0),scale=1);
dot((4,0),scale=1);

draw((-8,-8)--(6,6),fill=grey);

show(shift(0.5cm)*scale(1.5)*currentpicture);
```
