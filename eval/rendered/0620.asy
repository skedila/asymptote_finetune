You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a precise and detailed mathematical diagram based on the following description:

1. **Diagram Setup**: Begin by considering a horizontal line segment on a coordinate plane. The diagram should be scaled such that the entire figure fits within an 8 cm wide area.

2. **Line Segment**: Draw a line segment, denoted as \( g \), starting at the point \((0,0)\) and ending at the point \((1,0)\). This line segment lies entirely on the x-axis, extending from the origin to the point \((1,0)\).

3. **Arrow on the Segment**: Place an arrow on this line segment \( g \). The arrow should be positioned at a relative distance of 75% along the segment, originating from the starting point \((0,0)\) and pointing towards the endpoint \((1,0)\). The arrow should seamlessly integrate into the line, maintaining the same direction as the segment.
