You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with visualizing a geometric configuration on a Cartesian plane with a customized coordinate system. Follow these detailed instructions to construct the diagram:

1. **Coordinate System**: Establish a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at point \( (0,0) \). The basis vectors are non-standard: \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5) \) and \( \mathbf{j} = (-0.5, 0.75) \). This means the x-axis is tilted upwards at a 26.57-degree angle from the horizontal, and the y-axis is tilted upwards at a 123.69-degree angle from the horizontal.

2. **Point \( A \)**: Plot a point \( A \) at coordinates \( (2, -2) \) within this coordinate system. Label this point as \( A \), and use a red dot to mark its location. Position the label below the point.

3. **Circle \( C \)**
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

// Define the custom basis vectors
vector i = (1, 0.5);
vector j = (-0.5, 0.75);

// Define the custom coordinate system
coordinate system cs = (0,0,i,j);

// Plot the point A
point A = (2,-2);
draw(A, red, label("A", A.south));

// Draw the circle C with radius 1 centered at the origin
draw(circle(0,0,1), blue);

// Set the view to the custom coordinate system
view(cs);
```
