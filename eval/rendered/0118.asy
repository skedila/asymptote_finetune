You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing the following geometric construction, which involves a specific closed curve and several key points:

Consider a plane with four distinct points labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \). These points are defined by their Cartesian coordinates as follows:
- Point \( A \) is located at the origin, \((0,0)\).
- Point \( B \) is positioned at \((0,1)\), directly above point \( A \) along the y-axis.
- Point \( C \) is at \((1,0)\), directly to the right of point \( A\) along the x-axis.
- Point \( D \) is at \((1,1)\), which is diagonally above and to the right of point \( A \).

These points form the vertices of a square when connected in a specific sequence. The task involves the construction of a smooth, continuous curve that passes through these points in the following order:
