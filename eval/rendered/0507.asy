 Consider a square plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system with vertices at the points \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), \((1,1)\), and \((0,1)\). This forms a unit square.

Within this square, two diagonals are drawn: one from the bottom-left vertex \((0,0)\) to the top-right vertex \((1,1)\), and the other from the bottom-right vertex \((1,0)\) to the top-left vertex \((0,1)\). These diagonals intersect at the center of the square, which is the point \((0.5, 0.5)\).

Additionally, points are marked (or "dotted") at the four vertices of the square, namely \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), \((1,1)\), and \((0,1)\), as well as at the intersection points of the diagonals, which
