 Consider a mathematical diagram with the following components:

1. **Point F**: A point labeled \( F \) is located at the coordinates \( (1, 0.5) \). This point is marked with a red dot and labeled to the east of the point.

2. **Parabola p**: A parabola is defined with focus at point \( F \) and a directrix parallel to the x-axis. The parabola opens upwards with a parameter of 0.2, and it spans an angular range from -110 degrees to 110 degrees. The parabola is drawn in the diagram.

3. **Coordinate Systems**:
   - **Current Coordinate System (R)**: The current coordinate system is shown, with its axes visible. The origin and orientation of this system are not explicitly labeled.
   - **Canonical Cartesian System (Rp)**: A new coordinate system, Rp, is defined relative to the parabola. This system is shown with its origin labeled
