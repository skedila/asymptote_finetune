You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric construction on a two-dimensional plane. The following elements are included in the diagram:

1. **Points and Coordinates:**
   - Point \( A \) is located at the origin, with coordinates \( (0, 0) \).
   - Point \( B \) is located on the positive x-axis, with coordinates \( (6, 0) \). The units are in centimeters.

2. **Curve:**
   - A smooth curve is drawn starting from point \( A \) and ending at point \( B \). The curve is constructed in such a way that it begins at \( A \) with an initial direction pointing north (upward), and it smoothly transitions to end at \( B \) with a direction also pointing north. This implies that the curve is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis passing through the midpoint of the segment \( AB \).

3. **Point Marking:**
   - Both points \( A \) and
