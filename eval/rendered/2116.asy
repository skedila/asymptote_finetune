You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code generates a visually intricate mathematical diagram that can be described as follows:

1. **Overall Dimensions**: The diagram is set within a bounding box sized at 10 cm, which is then rotated -90 degrees and filled with a light yellow color.

2. **Unit Circle**: At the center of the diagram, there is a unit circle, which is initially drawn and then unfilled, appearing as a white outline on the diagram.

3. **Rolling Paths**: The main feature of the diagram consists of a series of paths generated by a rolling motion. These paths are created by simulating the rolling of a circle along a line, effectively creating a series of cycloidal curves. The paths are defined by the function `roll`, which uses trigonometric functions to simulate the rolling effect.

4. **Vertical Extent**: The rolling paths extend vertically from \( y = -4\pi \) to \( y = 4\pi \). The paths
