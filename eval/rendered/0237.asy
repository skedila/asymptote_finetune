 The diagram consists of several elements plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system, with specific points, a line, and a hyperbola. Here is a detailed description of the elements:

1. **Bounding Box**: The diagram is contained within a bounding box defined by the rectangle with corners at \((-6, -5)\) and \((10, 2)\). The box itself is not visible but serves to set the limits of the diagram.

2. **Points**:
   - Point \(A\) is located at coordinates \((-2, -2)\). It is labeled with the letter "A" positioned to the north of the point and is colored red.
   - Point \(B\) is located at coordinates \((2, -3)\). It is labeled with the letter "B" positioned to the south of the point and is colored red.
   - Point \(C\) is located at coordinates \((2, -1.5)\). It is labeled with
