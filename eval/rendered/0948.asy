You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a specific geometric curve and its associated path. Consider the following setup on a Cartesian plane:

1. **Points Definition:**
   - Point \( A \) is located at the origin, with coordinates \( (0, 0) \).
   - Point \( B \) is at \( (3, 0.5) \).
   - Point \( C \) is at \( (6, 0) \).

2. **Curve Construction:**
   - A smooth curve is drawn from point \( A \) to point \( C \), passing through point \( B \).
   - The curve is defined with the following constraints:
     - At point \( A \), the tangent to the curve is directed towards the north (\( N \)).
     - At point \( B \), the tangent to the curve is directed towards the east (\( E \)).
     - At point \( C \), the tangent to the curve is directed towards the south
