You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric figure constructed on a coordinate plane. The figure is a right triangle, and you are to consider the following details:

1. **Vertices**: The triangle has its vertices at the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 6)\), and \((6, 0)\). These coordinates are given in centimeters.

2. **Right Triangle**: The triangle is a right triangle. The right angle is located at the origin \((0, 0)\).

3. **Legs of the Triangle**: 
   - One leg of the triangle lies along the y-axis, extending from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 6)\).
   - The other leg lies along the x-axis, extending from \((0, 0)\) to \((6, 0)\).

4. **Hypotenuse**: The hypotenuse of the triangle is the line segment connecting the
