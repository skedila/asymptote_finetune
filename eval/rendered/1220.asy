You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a simple geometric diagram on a Cartesian coordinate plane. The diagram consists of the following elements:

1. **Coordinate System Display**: The coordinate system is explicitly shown, indicating that the axes and possibly the grid are visible for reference.

2. **Points**:
   - Point \( A \) is located at the coordinates \((0, 0.5)\).
   - Point \( B \) is located at the coordinates \((1, 0.5)\).

3. **Labels**:
   - Point \( A \) is labeled with the text "$A$".
   - Point \( B \) is labeled with the text "$B$".

4. **Visual Style**:
   - The points \( A \) and \( B \) are marked with dots, and their respective labels are placed nearby for identification.

The task involves understanding the placement of these points within the coordinate system. You should consider the following:

- The points \( A \
 import geometry;

size(10cm,0);

draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);

dot((0,0.5), red);
dot((1,0.5), red);

label("$A$", (0,0.5), S);
label("$B$", (1,0.5), S);

draw((0,0.5)--(1,0.5), red);
