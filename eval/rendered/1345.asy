You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a detailed mathematical diagram based on the following specifications:

1. **Coordinate System**: Establish a Cartesian coordinate system with an origin at point \((2, 1)\). The basis vectors for this system are \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.25, 0.75)\). This defines a skewed coordinate system where the x-axis is along vector \(\mathbf{i}\) and the y-axis is along vector \(\mathbf{j}\).

2. **Focus Point**: Identify and mark the focus point \(F\) at coordinates \((0.25, 0.5)\) within this skewed coordinate system. Label this point as \(F\) and use a red dot to highlight it. Position the label to the southwest of the point.

3. **Bounding Box**: Extend the visible area of your diagram by drawing an invisible bounding box
 import geometry;

size(10cm,0cm);

// Define the skewed coordinate system
point i = (1,0.5);
point j = (-0.25,0.75);

// Draw the coordinate system
draw(i--(0,0), Arrow(6mm));
draw(j--(0,0), Arrow(6mm));

// Mark the focus point F
point F = (0.25,0.5);
dot(F, red);
label("$F$", F, SW);

// Draw the bounding box
draw(box((-1,0), (3,1)));
