You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a diagram involving several horizontal lines, each 5 cm in length, with various types of arrowheads. The diagram is composed of eight distinct lines, each shifted vertically from one another by 1 cm, starting from a base position at (6 cm, 0) in the coordinate plane. The lines are described as follows:

1. **First Line**: This line is positioned at y = 0 cm, starting at (6 cm, 0) and ending at (11 cm, 0). It features a single arrowhead at the end, styled as a hook.

2. **Second Line**: Positioned at y = -1 cm, this line spans from (6 cm, -1 cm) to (11 cm, -1 cm). It has a hook-style arrowhead at the beginning.

3. **Third Line**: Located at y = -2 cm, it extends from (6 cm, -2 cm) to (11 cm
