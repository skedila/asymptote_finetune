You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a diagram consisting of three key points and several curves connecting them. The points are defined as follows: \( A = (0, 0) \), \( B = (3, 5) \), and \( C = (6, 0) \). These points form a triangle in the Cartesian plane.

1. **Points and Lines:**
   - Point \( A \) is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Point \( B \) is located at coordinates \((3, 5)\).
   - Point \( C \) is positioned at \((6, 0)\).

2. **Curves:**
   - The first curve is a smooth, natural cubic spline passing through points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). This curve is drawn with a default line thickness of 1 mm.
   
   - The second curve is drawn in grey and features varying tension parameters. It starts
 ```asymptote
import geometry;

point A=(0,0);
point B=(3,5);
point C=(6,0);

draw(cubicspline(A,B,C), linewidth(1mm));
draw(grey(0.5,0.5,0.5), cubicspline(A,B,C,tension=0.5));
draw(grey(0.5,0.5,0.5), cubicspline(A,B,C,tension=0.8));
draw(grey(0.5,0.5,0.5), cubicspline(A,B,C,tension=1.2));
draw(grey(0.5,0.5,0.5), cubicspline(A,B,C,tension=1.5));
draw(grey(0.5,0.5,0.5), cubicspline(A,B,C,tension=1.8));
