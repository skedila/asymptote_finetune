You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a diagram consisting of four horizontal line segments, each 5 centimeters in length. These segments are parallel to each other and aligned from left to right. They are positioned at different vertical coordinates and are distinguished by their arrowhead styles and fill properties as follows:

1. **First Line Segment**: 
   - Position: The line extends from the point \((0, 0)\) to \((5, 0)\).
   - Arrowhead: It has a hook-style arrowhead at the right end.
   - Arrowhead Style: The arrowhead is not filled.

2. **Second Line Segment**:
   - Position: The line is shifted 1 centimeter downward, running from \((0, -1)\) to \((5, -1)\).
   - Arrowhead: It has a hook-style arrowhead at the right end.
   - Arrowhead Style: The arrowhead is filled with a semi-transparent red color (\(80\
