You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with creating a Cartesian coordinate system diagram with specific characteristics. Follow these detailed instructions to accurately replicate the visual rendering described by the Asymptote code:

1. **Coordinate System Setup:**
   - Draw a Cartesian plane with the x-axis ranging from -3 to 2 and the y-axis ranging from -3 to 3.
   - The diagram should be scaled such that 1 unit on both axes corresponds to 2 cm in physical space.

2. **Axes Details:**
   - The x-axis should be labeled with the variable "$x$" and should include tick marks. These tick marks should have labels formatted to omit zero (NoZeroFormat) and should be colored in red. The thickness of the tick marks should be 1bp (a typographical unit).
   - The y-axis should be labeled with the variable "$y$" and should also include similar tick marks and labels as the x-axis, with the same red color and 1bp thickness
