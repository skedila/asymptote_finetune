You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 Create a mathematical diagram based on the following description:

1. **Canvas Size**: The diagram should fit within a 6 cm by 6 cm square.

2. **Ellipse**: Draw a filled ellipse centered at the origin \((0, 0)\). The ellipse should have the following properties:
   - The horizontal axis (major axis) of the ellipse should have a length of 2 units.
   - The vertical axis (minor axis) should have a length of 1 unit.
   - The ellipse should be filled with a default color, as no specific color is defined in the code.

3. **Additional Instructions**:
   - Upon completion of rendering the diagram, include a hidden label at the origin \((0, 0)\) with the text "Read the code to understand...". This label should be in white, making it invisible against a default white background.

This setup will produce a visually simple diagram featuring a centered ellipse that is twice as wide as it
 size(6cm,6cm);

draw(ellipse((0,0),2,1),fill);

label("Read the code to understand...", (0,0), hidden);
