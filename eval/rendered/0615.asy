 Consider a coordinate plane where we define a horizontal path \( g \) from the point \((0,0)\) to the point \((1,0)\). This path represents a straight line segment along the x-axis, starting at the origin and ending at the point \((1,0)\).

On this path, there are two arrows drawn to indicate direction:

1. The first arrow is placed at 45% of the way along the path from \((0,0)\) to \((1,0)\). This arrow points in the direction from the origin towards \((1,0)\).

2. The second arrow is placed at 55% of the way along the same path. This arrow also points in the direction from the origin towards \((1,0)\).

Both arrows are drawn on the path \( g \), and they visually indicate the direction of movement from the origin towards the endpoint of the path at \((1,0)\). The arrows
