You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing the following geometric configuration on the Cartesian plane:

1. **Points and Labels**:
   - Point \( A \) is located at coordinates \((-1, -1)\).
   - Point \( B \) is located at coordinates \( (2, 1) \).
   - Both points \( A \) and \( B \) are marked with red dots. Point \( A \) is labeled as "$A$" below the point (South), and point \( B \) is labeled as "$B$" above the point (North).

2. **Line**:
   - A straight line \( l \) is drawn through points \( A \) and \( B \).

3. **Focus and Parabola**:
   - The focus \( F \) of a parabola is at the coordinates \( (2, -1.5) \).
   - Point \( F \) is marked with a dot and labeled as "$F$
