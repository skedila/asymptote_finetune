 The diagram is set up in a custom coordinate system with the origin at point \( O = (2, 1) \), and the basis vectors \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 0.25)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-0.25, 0.75)\). This coordinate system is displayed with the origin labeled as \( O \).

Within this coordinate system, consider the following geometric constructs:

1. **Line \( l_1 \):** This is a line segment defined by the points \( A = (1, 1) \) and \( B = (2, 2) \). The line is labeled as \( l_1 \).

2. **Line \( l_2 \):** This line is generated by rotating line \( l_1 \) by \( 100^\circ \) around the point \( (3, 3) \). The line is labeled as \( l_2 \).
