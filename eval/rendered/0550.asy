 Consider a series of horizontal lines on a coordinate plane, each extending from the point \((0,0)\) to the point \((6,0)\).

1. **Solid Line**: The first line is a solid line positioned along the x-axis, from \((0,0)\) to \((6,0)\).

2. **Dotted Line**: Directly beneath the solid line, there is a dotted line. This line is parallel to the x-axis, extending from \((0,-1)\) to \((6,-1)\).

3. **Dashed Line**: Below the dotted line, there is a dashed line. It is also parallel to the x-axis, running from \((0,-2)\) to \((6,-2)\).

4. **Long Dashed Line**: The next line is a long dashed line, situated below the dashed line. It stretches from \((0,-3)\) to \((6,-
