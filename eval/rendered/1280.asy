You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 In this problem, you are asked to consider a Cartesian coordinate system that is transformed from the standard basis using a new origin and basis vectors. The transformed coordinate system has its origin at the point \((2, 1)\), with the basis vectors \(\mathbf{i} = (1, 1)\) and \(\mathbf{j} = (-4, 1)\).

Within this coordinate system, identify two specific points \(A\) and \(B\) given by their coordinates in the transformed system: \(A = (1, 1)\) and \(B = (2, 1)\). 

1. **Line Construction and Visualization:**
   - Construct the line \(l_1\) that passes through points \(A\) and \(B\).
   - Draw this line \(l_1\) in red on the coordinate plane.

2. **Point Identification and Labeling:**
   - Mark and label the points \(A\) and
 \begin{asy}
import geometry;

size(10cm,0);

// Define the new origin and basis vectors
point O = (2,1);
vector i = (1,1);
vector j = (-4,1);

// Transform the points A and B
point A = O + 1*i + 1*j;
point B = O + 2*i + 1*j;

// Draw the line l1
draw(l1=A--B, red);

// Mark and label the points A and B
dot(A, "A");
dot(B, "B");

// Draw the basis vectors
draw(i, Arrow(TeXHead));
draw(j, Arrow(TeXHead));

// Draw the transformed coordinate axes
draw(O--(O+i), Arrow(TeXHead));
draw(O--(O+j), Arrow(TeXHead));

// Label the axes
label("$x'$", (O+i), S);
label("$y'$", (O+j), E);

// Label the points
