 In this problem, we will explore transformations in a two-dimensional coordinate system using vector and point manipulations. We have two coordinate systems, the default Cartesian system \( R \) and a transformed Cartesian system \( R' \).

1. **Coordinate Systems:**
   - The default coordinate system \( R \) has the origin \( O \) at (0, 0) with standard basis vectors \(\vec{\imath}\) and \(\vec{\jmath}\).
   - The transformed coordinate system \( R' \) has its origin \( O' \) at (1.25, 0.75). The basis vectors are \(\vec{u} = (1, 0.5)\) and \(\vec{v} = (-1, 1)\).

2. **Vector and Point Definitions:**
   - Define a vector \(\overrightarrow{w} = (0.25, 0.5)\) in the default coordinate system
 import geometry;

// Define the default coordinate system R
coordinate R = (0, 0);
point O = R;
vector i = (1, 0);
vector j = (0, 1);

// Define the transformed coordinate system R'
coordinate R' = (1.25, 0.75);
point O' = R';
vector u = (1, 0.5);
vector v = (-1, 1);

// Define the vector w in the default coordinate system
vector w = (0.25, 0.5);
