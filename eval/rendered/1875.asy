**Mathematical Surface Plot Description:**

1. **Coordinate System and Projection:**
   - The plot is rendered in a three-dimensional orthographic projection with a viewpoint specified by the vector (2, -2, 2.5). This projection provides a realistic view of the surface without perspective distortion.

2. **Surface Definition:**
   - The surface is defined over a domain in the xy-plane, ranging from (0, 0) to (14, 14). The function \( f(u, v) = \frac{u/2 + v}{2 + \cos(u/2) \cdot \sin(v)} \) is used to compute the z-coordinate for each point (u, v) on this domain.

3. **Surface Rendering:**
   - The surface is approximated using a grid of
 ```asymptote
import three;

size(10cm,0);

// Define the viewpoint
view(2, -2, 2.5);

// Define the domain for the surface
real u = 0, v = 0;

// Define the surface function
real f(real u, real v) = (u/2 + v)/(2 + cos(u/2) * sin(v));

// Create a grid of points for the surface
real umin = 0, umax = 14, vmin = 0, vmax = 14;
real ustep = 0.1, vstep = 0.1;

// Generate the surface points
real[][] surface = {
    for(u = umin, u < umax, u += ustep,
        for(v = vmin, v < vmax, v += vstep,
            (u, v, f(u, v))
        )
    };

// Plot the surface
draw(surface,
     color(blue),
