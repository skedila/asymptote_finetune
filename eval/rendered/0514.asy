You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with visualizing a simple geometric configuration on a Cartesian plane. Consider the following points and their respective characteristics:

- Point \( A \) is located at the origin, with coordinates \( (0, 0) \). It is represented as a black dot with a diameter of 8 basis points.
- Point \( B \) is situated at \( (1, 0) \) on the x-axis. It is depicted as a blue dot, also with a diameter of 8 basis points.
- Point \( C \) is positioned at \( (2, 0) \) on the x-axis. This point is represented as a dot with a diameter of 8 basis points, but the color is not specified, suggesting it defaults to black or another standard color.

Your task is to plot these points on a diagram, ensuring that the sizes and colors of the points are accurately represented as specified above. Each point should be clearly distinguishable, and their alignment along the
