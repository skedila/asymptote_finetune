 Consider the Cartesian coordinate plane. You are tasked with analyzing a series of transformations applied to the unit circle, defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. **Original Circle**: Begin by considering the unit circle centered at the origin (0,0). This circle has a radius of 1.

2. **Drawing the Unit Circle**: This circle is drawn in red to distinguish it from other transformations. 

3. **Horizontal Stretch**: Next, apply a horizontal scaling transformation to the unit circle. Specifically, scale the circle by a factor of 2 along the x-axis. This transforms the unit circle into an ellipse with the equation \( \frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1 \), resulting in an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-major axis of length 2 along the x-axis and a semi-minor axis of length 1 along the y-axis.

4. **Vertical Stretch**: Similarly
