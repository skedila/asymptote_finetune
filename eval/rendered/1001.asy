You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 The Asymptote code provided generates a mathematical diagram featuring a visually striking circle with specific shading and line elements. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

1. **Circle Definition**:
   - The primary geometric object is a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 2 units. This circle is defined by scaling the unit circle by a factor of 2.

2. **Shading**:
   - Two distinct radial shading effects are applied:
     - The first shading effect is a radial gradient centered at \((0, 0)\) with a transition from white at the center to yellow at a radius of 4 units. This creates a large, subtle background gradient effect that extends beyond the circle.
     - The second shading effect is a smaller radial gradient, centered at \((1, 0.5)\). This gradient transitions from white at the center to a shade of blue at a radius of 2 units. This
