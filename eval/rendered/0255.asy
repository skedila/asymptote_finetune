You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with analyzing a geometric diagram based on the following description:

1. **Coordinate System and Line Description**: 
   - The diagram is set in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.
   - Two points, \( A \) at coordinates \((0,0)\) and \( B \) at coordinates \((2,1)\), are connected by a line \( l \).

2. **Line Representation**:
   - The line \( l \) is drawn between points \( A \) and \( B \).
   - The line is visually represented in blue color.

3. **Points on the Line**:
   - **Relative Point 1**: 
     - A point labeled "relpoint(l, 1)" is marked on the line \( l \) using the relative parameterization method. It is located at the end of the line \( l \) (equivalent to point \( B \)).
     - This point is indicated by a dot with
 import geometry;

size(10cm,0);

draw((0,0)--(2,1),blue);

dot("relpoint(l, 1)", relpoint(l, 1), N);
