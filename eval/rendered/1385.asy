 Consider the following geometric configuration on a Cartesian plane:

1. **Points and Labels:**
   - Point \( A \) is located at coordinates \((-1, -1)\).
   - Point \( B \) is located at coordinates \((0.75, 0.5)\).
   - Both points \( A \) and \( B \) are marked with red dots. Point \( A \) is labeled as "A" and positioned to the northwest of the point, while point \( B \) is labeled as "B" and positioned to the north of the point.

2. **Circles:**
   - Circle \( c_1 \) is centered at point \( A \) with a radius of 1.5 units.
   - Circle \( c_2 \) is centered at point \( B \) with a radius of 2 units.
   - Both circles are drawn on the plane and intersect at two points.

3. **Intersection Points:
