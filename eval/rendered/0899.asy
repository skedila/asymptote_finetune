You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with visualizing a geometric figure based on the following description:

1. **Canvas Size**: The drawing is set within a square canvas with dimensions 6 cm by 6 cm.

2. **Unitsquare**: Begin by considering a unit square, which is a square with vertices at the coordinates (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1).

3. **Rounded Path**: Construct a path that traces the perimeter of the unit square but with rounded corners. Each corner of the square is rounded with a radius of 0.4 units. This path smoothly transitions through the corners, forming a continuous loop.

4. **Drawing the Rounded Path**: The path with rounded corners is drawn prominently. 

5. **Dotting the Rounded Path**: Place small red dots along the rounded path to highlight its presence and continuity. These dots are distributed evenly along the entire path.

6. **Drawing the Original Square**:
 ```asymptote

import geometry;


size(6cm);


unitsquare = unitbox((0,0), (1,1));


path roundedPath = path(0,0,1,0) .. arc(0,0,0.4,0.4,0) .. path(1,0,1,1) .. arc(1,0,0.4,0.4,0) .. path(1,1,0,1) .. arc(1,1,0.4,0.4,0) .. path(0,1,0,0) .. arc(0,1,0.4,0.4,0);


draw(roundedPath, linewidth(2pt), red);

dot(roundedPath, red);


draw(unitsquare, linewidth(2pt));

```
