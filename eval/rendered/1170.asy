You are a helpful assistant that writes Asymptote code.
 You are tasked with visualizing a geometric construction based on the following instructions:

1. **Setup**: Consider a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle of radius \(4 \text{ cm}\). The center of this circle is the origin of the coordinate system, and one of its vertices, denoted as \(A\), is located at the top of the circle (along the positive y-axis).

2. **Pentagon Construction**: 
   - Let the vertices of the pentagon be labeled \(A_0, A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\), where \(A_0 = A\).
   - The angle subtended by each side of the pentagon at the center is \(72^\circ\).

3. **Line Segment and Rotation**:
   - Draw a line segment \(p\) starting from \(A_0\) and extending slightly beyond \(A_1\), the next vertex of the pentagon

// Circle with radius 4 cm
draw(circle(0,0,4cm),linewidth(1));

// Regular pentagon inscribed in the circle
real angle = 72*pi/180; // 72 degrees in radians
real radius = 4;

// Vertex A0 at the top of the circle
point A0 = (0,radius);

// Vertices of the pentagon
point A1 = A0 + rotate(angle)*(radius,0);
point A2 = A1 + rotate(angle)*(radius,0);
point A3 = A2 + rotate(angle)*(radius,0);
point A4 = A3 + rotate(angle)*(radius,0);
point A5 = A4 + rotate(angle)*(radius,0);

// Line segment p
point p = A0 + rotate(angle)*(radius,0);

// Draw the pentagon
draw(A0--A1--A2--A3--A4--A5--cycle);

// Draw the line segment p
