The function \\( f(u, v) = \\frac{u/2 + v}{2 + \\cos(u/2) \\cdot \\sin(v)} \\) is used to compute the z-coordinate for each point (u, v) on this domain.\n\n3. **Surface Rendering:**\n   - The surface is approximated using a grid of\n ```asymptote\nimport three;\n\nsize(10cm,0);\n\n// Define the viewpoint\nview(2, -2, 2.5);\n\n// Define the domain for the surface\nreal u = 0, v = 0;\n\n// Define the surface function\nreal f(real u, real v) = (u/2 + v)/(2 + cos(u/2) * sin(v));\n\n// Create a grid of points for the surface\nreal umin = 0, umax = 14, vmin = 0, vmax = 14;\nreal ustep = 0.1, vstep = 0.1;\n\n// Generate the surface points\nreal[][] surface = {\n    for(u = umin, u < umax, u += ustep,\n        for(v = vmin, v < vmax, v += vstep,\n            (u, v, f(u, v))\n        )\n    };\n\n// Plot the surface\ndraw(surface,\n     color(blue),\n     smooth,\n     xlabel(\"u"}

{"id": "1001", "description": "The Asymptote code provided generates a mathematical diagram featuring a visually striking circle with specific shading and line elements. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:\n\n1. **Circle Definition**:\n   - The primary geometric object is a circle centered at the origin \\((0, 0)\\) with a radius of 2 units. This circle is defined by scaling the unit circle by a factor of 2.\n\n2. **Shading**:\n   - Two distinct radial shading effects are applied:\n     - The first shading effect is a radial gradient centered at \\((0, 0)\\) with a transition from white at the center to yellow at a radius of 4 units. This creates a large, subtle background gradient effect that extends beyond the circle.\n     - The second shading effect is a smaller radial gradient, centered at \\((1, 0.5)\\). This gradient transitions from white at the center to a shade of blue at a radius of 2 units.
